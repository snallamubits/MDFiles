Preface

PREFACE

We ﬁrst came to focus on what is now known as reinforcement learning in late
1979. We were both at the University of Massachusetts, working on one of
the earliest projects to revive the idea that networks of neuronlike adaptive
elements might prove to be a promising approach to artiﬁcial adaptive intel-
ligence. The project explored the “heterostatic theory of adaptive systems”
developed by A. Harry Klopf. Harry’s work was a rich source of ideas, and
we were permitted to explore them critically and compare them with the long
history of prior work in adaptive systems. Our task became one of teasing
the ideas apart and understanding their relationships and relative importance.
This continues today, but in 1979 we came to realize that perhaps the simplest
of the ideas, which had long been taken for granted, had received surprisingly
little attention from a computational perspective. This was simply the idea of
a learning system that wants something, that adapts its behavior in order to
maximize a special signal from its environment. This was the idea of a “he-
donistic” learning system, or, as we would say now, the idea of reinforcement
learning.

Like others, we had a sense that reinforcement learning had been thor-
oughly explored in the early days of cybernetics and artiﬁcial intelligence. On
closer inspection, though, we found that it had been explored only slightly.
While reinforcement learning had clearly motivated some of the earliest com-
putational studies of learning, most of these researchers had gone on to other
things, such as pattern classiﬁcation, supervised learning, and adaptive con-
trol, or they had abandoned the study of learning altogether. As a result, the
special issues involved in learning how to get something from the environment
received relatively little attention.
In retrospect, focusing on this idea was
the critical step that set this branch of research in motion. Little progress
could be made in the computational study of reinforcement learning until it
was recognized that such a fundamental idea had not yet been thoroughly
explored.

The ﬁeld has come a long way since then, evolving and maturing in sev-
eral directions. Reinforcement learning has gradually become one of the most
active research areas in machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, and neural net-
work research. The ﬁeld has developed strong mathematical foundations and
impressive applications. The computational study of reinforcement learning is
now a large ﬁeld, with hundreds of active researchers around the world in di-
verse disciplines such as psychology, control theory, artiﬁcial intelligence, and
neuroscience. Particularly important have been the contributions establishing
and developing the relationships to the theory of optimal control and dynamic
programming. The overall problem of learning from interaction to achieve

goals is still far from being solved, but our understanding of it has improved
signiﬁcantly. We can now place component ideas, such as temporal-diﬀerence
learning, dynamic programming, and function approximation, within a coher-
ent perspective with respect to the overall problem.

Our goal in writing this book was to provide a clear and simple account of
the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. We wanted our treat-
ment to be accessible to readers in all of the related disciplines, but we could
not cover all of these perspectives in detail. For the most part, our treatment
takes the point of view of artiﬁcial intelligence and engineering. In this second
edition, we plan to have one chapter summarizing the connections to psychol-
ogy and neuroscience, which are many and rapidly developing. Coverage of
connections to other ﬁelds we leave to others or to another time. We also
chose not to produce a rigorous formal treatment of reinforcement learning.
We did not reach for the highest possible level of mathematical abstraction
and did not rely on a theorem–proof format. We tried to choose a level of
mathematical detail that points the mathematically inclined in the right di-
rections without distracting from the simplicity and potential generality of the
underlying ideas.

The book consists of three parts. Part I is introductory and problem ori-
ented. We focus on the simplest aspects of reinforcement learning and on its
main distinguishing features. One full chapter is devoted to introducing the
reinforcement learning problem whose solution we explore in the rest of the
book. Part II presents tabular versions (assuming a small ﬁnite state space)
of all the basic solution methods based on estimating action values. We intro-
duce dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-diﬀerence
learning. There is a chapter on eligibility traces which uniﬁes the latter two
methods, and a chapter that uniﬁes planning methods (such as dynamic pro-
gramming and state-space search) and learning methods (such as Monte Carlo
and temporal-diﬀerence learning). Part III is concerned with extending the
tabular methods to include various forms of approximation including function
approximation, policy-gradient methods, and methods designed for solving
oﬀ-policy learning problems. Part IV surveys some of the frontiers of rein-
forcement learning in biology and applications.

This book was designed to be used as a text in a one- or two-semester
course, perhaps supplemented by readings from the literature or by a more
mathematical text such as Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996) or Szepesvari (2010).
This book can also be used as part of a broader course on machine learning,
artiﬁcial intelligence, or neural networks. In this case, it may be desirable to
cover only a subset of the material. We recommend covering Chapter 1 for a
brief overview, Chapter 2 through Section 2.2, Chapter 3 except Sections 3.4,
3.5 and 3.9, and then selecting sections from the remaining chapters according

x

PREFACE

to time and interests. The ﬁve chapters of Part II build on each other and are
best covered in sequence; of these, Chapter 6 is the most important for the
subject and for the rest of the book. A course focusing on machine learning
or neural networks should cover Chapter 9, and a course focusing on artiﬁcial
intelligence or planning should cover Chapter 8. Throughout the book, sections
that are more diﬃcult and not essential to the rest of the book are marked
. These can be omitted on ﬁrst reading without creating problems
with a
∗
later on. Some exercises are marked with a
to indicate that they are more
advanced and not essential to understanding the basic material of the chapter.

∗

The book is largely self-contained. The only mathematical background
assumed is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability, such as expec-
tations of random variables. Chapter 9 is substantially easier to digest if the
reader has some knowledge of artiﬁcial neural networks or some other kind of
supervised learning method, but it can be read without prior background. We
strongly recommend working the exercises provided throughout the book. So-
lution manuals are available to instructors. This and other related and timely
material is available via the Internet.

At the end of most chapters is a section entitled “Bibliographical and His-
torical Remarks,” wherein we credit the sources of the ideas presented in that
chapter, provide pointers to further reading and ongoing research, and describe
relevant historical background. Despite our attempts to make these sections
authoritative and complete, we have undoubtedly left out some important
prior work. For that we apologize, and welcome corrections and extensions for
incorporation into a subsequent edition.

In some sense we have been working toward this book for thirty years, and
we have lots of people to thank. First, we thank those who have personally
helped us develop the overall view presented in this book: Harry Klopf, for
helping us recognize that reinforcement learning needed to be revived; Chris
Watkins, Dimitri Bertsekas, John Tsitsiklis, and Paul Werbos, for helping us
see the value of the relationships to dynamic programming; John Moore and
Jim Kehoe, for insights and inspirations from animal learning theory; Oliver
Selfridge, for emphasizing the breadth and importance of adaptation; and,
more generally, our colleagues and students who have contributed in countless
ways: Ron Williams, Charles Anderson, Satinder Singh, Sridhar Mahadevan,
Steve Bradtke, Bob Crites, Peter Dayan, and Leemon Baird. Our view of re-
inforcement learning has been signiﬁcantly enriched by discussions with Paul
Cohen, Paul Utgoﬀ, Martha Steenstrup, Gerry Tesauro, Mike Jordan, Leslie
Kaelbling, Andrew Moore, Chris Atkeson, Tom Mitchell, Nils Nilsson, Stuart
Russell, Tom Dietterich, Tom Dean, and Bob Narendra. We thank Michael
Littman, Gerry Tesauro, Bob Crites, Satinder Singh, and Wei Zhang for pro-
viding speciﬁcs of Sections 4.7, 15.1, 15.4, 15.5, and 15.6 respectively. We

The Reinforcement Learning
Problem

The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the
ﬁrst to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning. When an
infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it
does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this
connection produces a wealth of information about cause and eﬀect, about
the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals.
Throughout our lives, such interactions are undoubtedly a major source of
knowledge about our environment and ourselves. Whether we are learning to
drive a car or to hold a conversation, we are acutely aware of how our environ-
ment responds to what we do, and we seek to inﬂuence what happens through
our behavior. Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying
nearly all theories of learning and intelligence.

In this book we explore a computational approach to learning from inter-
action. Rather than directly theorizing about how people or animals learn, we
explore idealized learning situations and evaluate the eﬀectiveness of various
learning methods. That is, we adopt the perspective of an artiﬁcial intelligence
researcher or engineer. We explore designs for machines that are eﬀective in
solving learning problems of scientiﬁc or economic interest, evaluating the
designs through mathematical analysis or computational experiments. The
approach we explore, called reinforcement learning, is much more focused on
goal-directed learning from interaction than are other approaches to machine
learning.

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

1.1 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is like many topics with names ending in -ing, such
as machine learning, planning, and mountaineering, in that it is simultane-
ously a problem, a class of solution methods that work well on the class of
problems, and the ﬁeld that studies these problems and their solution meth-
ods. Reinforcement learning problems involve learning what to do—how to
map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. In
an essential way they are closed-loop problems because the learning system’s
actions inﬂuence its later inputs. Moreover, the learner is not told which ac-
tions to take, as in many forms of machine learning, but instead must discover
which actions yield the most reward by trying them out. In the most interest-
ing and challenging cases, actions may aﬀect not only the immediate reward
but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These
three characteristics—being closed-loop in an essential way, not having direct
instructions as to what actions to take, and where the consequences of actions,
including reward signals, play out over extended time periods—are the three
most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning problems.

A full speciﬁcation of reinforcement learning problems in terms of optimal
control of Markov decision processes must wait until Chapter 3, but the basic
idea is simply to capture the most important aspects of the real problem facing
a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. Clearly,
such an agent must be able to sense the state of the environment to some extent
and must be able to take actions that aﬀect the state. The agent also must
have a goal or goals relating to the state of the environment. The formulation
is intended to include just these three aspects—sensation, action, and goal—in
their simplest possible forms without trivializing any of them.

Any method that is well suited to solving this kind of problem we consider
to be a reinforcement learning method. Reinforcement learning is diﬀerent
from supervised learning, the kind of learning studied in most current research
in ﬁeld of machine learning. Supervised learning is learning from a train-
ing set of labeled examples provided by a knowledgable external supervisor.
Each example is a description of a situation together with a speciﬁcation—the
label—of the correct action the system should take to that situation, which is
often to identify a category to which the situation belongs. The object of this
kind of learning is for the system to extrapolate, or generalize, its responses
so that it acts correctly in situations not present in the training set. This is
an important kind of learning, but alone it is not adequate for learning from
interaction. In interactive problems it is often impractical to obtain examples
of desired behavior that are both correct and representative of all the situa-
tions in which the agent has to act. In uncharted territory—where one would

1.1. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

3

expect learning to be most beneﬁcial—an agent must be able to learn from its
own experience.

Reinforcement learning is also diﬀerent from what machine learning re-
searchers call unsupervised learning, which is typically about ﬁnding struc-
ture hidden in collections of unlabeled data. The terms supervised learning
and unsupervised learning appear to exhaustively classify machine learning
paradigms, but they do not. Although one might be tempted to think of rein-
forcement learning as a kind of unsupervised learning because it does not rely
on examples of correct behavior, reinforcement learning is trying to maximize
a reward signal instead of trying to ﬁnd hidden structure. Uncovering struc-
ture in an agent’s experience can certainly be useful in reinforcement learning,
but by itself does not address the reinforcement learning agent’s problem of
maximizing a reward signal. We therefore consider reinforcement learning to
be a third machine learning paradigm, alongside of supervised learning, unsu-
pervised learning, and perhaps other paradigms as well.

One of the challenges that arise in reinforcement learning, and not in other
kinds of learning, is the trade-oﬀ between exploration and exploitation. To
obtain a lot of reward, a reinforcement learning agent must prefer actions
that it has tried in the past and found to be eﬀective in producing reward.
But to discover such actions, it has to try actions that it has not selected
before. The agent has to exploit what it already knows in order to obtain
reward, but it also has to explore in order to make better action selections in
the future. The dilemma is that neither exploration nor exploitation can be
pursued exclusively without failing at the task. The agent must try a variety of
actions and progressively favor those that appear to be best. On a stochastic
task, each action must be tried many times to gain a reliable estimate its
expected reward. The exploration–exploitation dilemma has been intensively
studied by mathematicians for many decades (see Chapter 2). For now, we
simply note that the entire issue of balancing exploration and exploitation
does not even arise in supervised and unsupervised learning, at least in their
purist forms.

Another key feature of reinforcement learning is that it explicitly considers
the whole problem of a goal-directed agent interacting with an uncertain envi-
ronment. This is in contrast with many approaches that consider subproblems
without addressing how they might ﬁt into a larger picture. For example,
we have mentioned that much of machine learning research is concerned with
supervised learning without explicitly specifying how such an ability would
ﬁnally be useful. Other researchers have developed theories of planning with
general goals, but without considering planning’s role in real-time decision-
making, or the question of where the predictive models necessary for planning
would come from. Although these approaches have yielded many useful results,

4

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

their focus on isolated subproblems is a signiﬁcant limitation.

Reinforcement learning takes the opposite tack, starting with a complete,
interactive, goal-seeking agent. All reinforcement learning agents have explicit
goals, can sense aspects of their environments, and can choose actions to inﬂu-
ence their environments. Moreover, it is usually assumed from the beginning
that the agent has to operate despite signiﬁcant uncertainty about the environ-
ment it faces. When reinforcement learning involves planning, it has to address
the interplay between planning and real-time action selection, as well as the
question of how environment models are acquired and improved. When rein-
forcement learning involves supervised learning, it does so for speciﬁc reasons
that determine which capabilities are critical and which are not. For learning
research to make progress, important subproblems have to be isolated and
studied, but they should be subproblems that play clear roles in complete,
interactive, goal-seeking agents, even if all the details of the complete agent
cannot yet be ﬁlled in.

One of the most exciting aspects of modern reinforcement learning is its
substantive and fruitful interactions with other engineering and scientiﬁc disci-
plines. Reinforcement learning is part of a decades-long trend within artiﬁcial
intelligence and machine learning toward greater integration with statistics,
optimization, and other mathematical subjects. For example, the ability of
some reinforcement learning methods to learn with parameterized approxima-
tors addresses the classical “curse of dimensionality” in operations research
and control theory. More distinctively, reinforcement learning has also in-
teracted strongly with psychology and neuroscience, with substantial beneﬁts
going both ways. Of all the forms of machine learning, reinforcement learn-
ing is the closest to the kind of learning that humans and other animals do,
and many of the core algorithms of reinforcement learning were originally in-
spired by biological learning systems. And reinforcement learning has also
given back, both through a psychological model of animal learning that better
matches some of the empirical data, and through an inﬂuential model of parts
of the brain’s reward system. The body of this book develops the ideas of
reinforcement learning that pertain to engineering and artiﬁcial intelligence,
with connections to psychology and neuroscience summarized in Chapters ??
and ??.

Finally, reinforcement learning is also part of a larger trend in artiﬁcial
intelligence back toward simple general principles. Since the late 1960’s, many
artiﬁcial intelligence researchers presumed that there are no general principles
to be discovered, that intelligence is instead due to the possession of vast num-
bers of special purpose tricks, procedures, and heuristics. It was sometimes
said that if we could just get enough relevant facts into a machine, say one mil-
lion, or one billion, then it would become intelligent. Methods based on general

1.2. EXAMPLES

5

principles, such as search or learning, were characterized as “weak methods,”
whereas those based on speciﬁc knowledge were called “strong methods.” This
view is still common today, but much less dominant. From our point of view,
it was simply premature: too little eﬀort had been put into the search for
general principles to conclude that there were none. Modern AI now includes
much research looking for general principles of learning, search, and decision-
making, as well as trying to incorporate vast amounts of domain knowledge. It
is not clear how far back the pendulum will swing, but reinforcement learning
research is certainly part of the swing back toward simpler and fewer general
principles of artiﬁcial intelligence.

1.2 Examples

A good way to understand reinforcement learning is to consider some of the
examples and possible applications that have guided its development.

level of its battery and how quickly and easily it has been able to ﬁnd

Phil prepares his breakfast. Closely examined, even this apparently mun-
dane activity reveals a complex web of conditional behavior and inter-
locking goal–subgoal relationships: walking to the cupboard, opening it,
selecting a cereal box, then reaching for, grasping, and retrieving the
box. Other complex, tuned, interactive sequences of behavior are re-
quired to obtain a bowl, spoon, and milk jug. Each step involves a series

6

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

of eye movements to obtain information and to guide reaching and loco-
motion. Rapid judgments are continually made about how to carry the
objects or whether it is better to ferry some of them to the dining table
before obtaining others. Each step is guided by goals, such as grasping
a spoon or getting to the refrigerator, and is in service of other goals,
such as having the spoon to eat with once the cereal is prepared and ul-
timately obtaining nourishment. Whether he is aware of it or not, Phil
is accessing information about the state of his body that determines his
nutritional needs, level of hunger, and food preferences.

These examples share features that are so basic that they are easy to over-
look. All involve interaction between an active decision-making agent and
its environment, within which the agent seeks to achieve a goal despite un-
certainty about its environment. The agent’s actions are permitted to aﬀect
the future state of the environment (e.g., the next chess position, the level of
reservoirs of the reﬁnery, the robot’s next location and the future charge level
of its battery), thereby aﬀecting the options and opportunities available to
the agent at later times. Correct choice requires taking into account indirect,
delayed consequences of actions, and thus may require foresight or planning.

At the same time, in all these examples the eﬀects of actions cannot be
fully predicted; thus the agent must monitor its environment frequently and
react appropriately. For example, Phil must watch the milk he pours into
his cereal bowl to keep it from overﬂowing. All these examples involve goals
that are explicit in the sense that the agent can judge progress toward its goal
based on what it can sense directly. The chess player knows whether or not
he wins, the reﬁnery controller knows how much petroleum is being produced,
the mobile robot knows when its batteries run down, and Phil knows whether
or not he is enjoying his breakfast.

Neither the agent nor its environment may coincide with what we normally
think of as an agent and its environment. An agent is not necessarily an entire
robot or organism, and its environment is not necessarily only what is outside
of a robot or organism. The example robot’s battery is part of the environment
of its controlling agent, and Phil’s degree of hunger and food preferences are
features of the environment of his internal decision-making agent. The state
of an agent’s environment often include’s information about the state of the
machine or organism in which the agent resides, and this can include memories
and even aspirations. Throughout this book we are being abstract in this way
when we talk about agents and their environments.

In all of these examples the agent can use its experience to improve its per-
formance over time. The chess player reﬁnes the intuition he uses to evaluate
positions, thereby improving his play; the gazelle calf improves the eﬃciency

with which it can run; Phil learns to streamline making his breakfast. The
knowledge the agent brings to the task at the start—either from previous ex-
perience with related tasks or built into it by design or evolution—inﬂuences
what is useful or easy to learn, but interaction with the environment is essential
for adjusting behavior to exploit speciﬁc features of the task.

1.3 Elements of Reinforcement Learning

Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify four main subelements
of a reinforcement learning system: a policy, a reward signal , a value function,
and, optionally, a model of the environment.

A policy deﬁnes the learning agent’s way of behaving at a given time.
Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the envi-
ronment to actions to be taken when in those states. It corresponds to what
in psychology would be called a set of stimulus–response rules or associations
(provided that stimuli include those that can come from within the animal).
In some cases the policy may be a simple function or lookup table, whereas
in others it may involve extensive computation such as a search process. The
policy is the core of a reinforcement learning agent in the sense that it alone
is suﬃcient to determine behavior. In general, policies may be stochastic.

A reward signal deﬁnes the goal in a reinforcement learning problem. On
each time step, the environment sends to the reinforcement learning agent a
single number, a reward. The agent’s sole objective is to maximize the total
reward it receives over the long run. The reward signal thus deﬁnes what are
the good and bad events for the agent. In a biological system, we might think
of rewards as analogous to the experiences of pleasure or pain. They are the
The
immediate and deﬁning features of the problem faced by the agent.
reward sent to the agent at any time depends on the agent’s current action
and the current state of the agent’s environment. The agent cannot alter the
process that does this. The only way the agent can inﬂuence the reward signal
is through its actions, which can have a direct eﬀect on reward, or an indirect
eﬀect through changing the environment’s state. In our example above of Phil
eating breakfast, the reinforcement learning agent directing his behavior might
receive diﬀerent reward signals when he eats his breakfast depending on how
hungry he is, what mood he is in, and other features of his of his body, which
is part of his internal reinforcement learning agent’s environment. The reward
signal is the primary basis for altering the policy. If an action selected by the
policy is followed by low reward, then the policy may be changed to select
some other action in that situation in the future. In general, reward signals
may be stochastic functions of the state of the environment and the actions

8

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

taken.

Whereas the reward signal indicates what is good in an immediate sense,
a value function speciﬁes what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the
value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate
over the future, starting from that state. Whereas rewards determine the
immediate, intrinsic desirability of environmental states, values indicate the
long-term desirability of states after taking into account the states that are
likely to follow, and the rewards available in those states. For example, a state
might always yield a low immediate reward but still have a high value because
it is regularly followed by other states that yield high rewards. Or the reverse
could be true. To make a human analogy, rewards are somewhat like pleasure
(if high) and pain (if low), whereas values correspond to a more reﬁned and
farsighted judgment of how pleased or displeased we are that our environment
is in a particular state. Expressed this way, we hope it is clear that value
functions formalize a basic and familiar idea.

Rewards are in a sense primary, whereas values, as predictions of rewards,
are secondary. Without rewards there could be no values, and the only purpose
of estimating values is to achieve more reward. Nevertheless, it is values with
which we are most concerned when making and evaluating decisions. Action
choices are made based on value judgments. We seek actions that bring about
states of highest value, not highest reward, because these actions obtain the
greatest amount of reward for us over the long run. In decision-making and
planning, the derived quantity called value is the one with which we are most
concerned. Unfortunately, it is much harder to determine values than it is to
determine rewards. Rewards are basically given directly by the environment,
but values must be estimated and re-estimated from the sequences of obser-
vations an agent makes over its entire lifetime. In fact, the most important
component of almost all reinforcement learning algorithms we consider is a
method for eﬃciently estimating values. The central role of value estimation
is arguably the most important thing we have learned about reinforcement
learning over the last few decades.

The fourth and ﬁnal element of some reinforcement learning systems is
a model of the environment. This is something that mimics the behavior of
the environment, or more generally, that allows inferences to be made about
how the environment will behave. For example, given a state and action,
the model might predict the resultant next state and next reward. Models
are used for planning, by which we mean any way of deciding on a course of
action by considering possible future situations before they are actually expe-
rienced. Methods for solving reinforcement learning problems that use models
and planning are called model-based methods, as opposed to simpler model-
free methods that are explicitly trial-and-error learners—viewed as almost the

1.4. LIMITATIONS AND SCOPE

9

opposite of planning. In Chapter 9 we explore reinforcement learning systems
that simultaneously learn by trial and error, learn a model of the environ-
ment, and use the model for planning. Modern reinforcement learning spans
the spectrum from low-level, trial-and-error learning to high-level, deliberative
planning.

1.4 Limitations and Scope

Most of the reinforcement learning methods we consider in this book are struc-
tured around estimating value functions, but it is not strictly necessary to do
this to solve reinforcement learning problems. For example, methods such as
genetic algorithms, genetic programming, simulated annealing, and other opti-
mization methods have been used to approach reinforcement learning problems
without ever appealing to value functions. These methods evaluate the “life-
time” behavior of many non-learning agents, each using a diﬀerent policy for
interacting with its environment, and select those that are able to obtain the
most reward. We call these evolutionary methods because their operation is
analogous to the way biological evolution produces organisms with skilled be-
havior even when they do not learn during their individual lifetimes. If the
space of policies is suﬃciently small, or can be structured so that good policies
are common or easy to ﬁnd—or if a lot of time is available for the search—then
evolutionary methods can be eﬀective. In addition, evolutionary methods have
advantages on problems in which the learning agent cannot accurately sense
the state of its environment.

Our focus is on reinforcement learning methods that involve learning while
interacting with the environment, which evolutionary methods do not do (un-
less they evolve learning algorithms, as in some of the approaches that have
been studied).
It is our belief that methods able to take advantage of the
details of individual behavioral interactions can be much more eﬃcient than
evolutionary methods in many cases. Evolutionary methods ignore much of
the useful structure of the reinforcement learning problem: they do not use
the fact that the policy they are searching for is a function from states to
actions; they do not notice which states an individual passes through during
In some cases this information can
its lifetime, or which actions it selects.
be misleading (e.g., when states are misperceived), but more often it should
enable more eﬃcient search. Although evolution and learning share many fea-
tures and naturally work together, we do not consider evolutionary methods
by themselves to be especially well suited to reinforcement learning problems.
For simplicity, in this book when we use the term “reinforcement learning
method” we do not include evolutionary methods.

10

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

However, we do include some methods that, like evolutionary methods,
do not appeal to value functions. These methods search in spaces of policies
deﬁned by a collection of numerical parameters. They estimate the directions
the parameters should be adjusted in order to most rapidly improve a policy’s
performance. Unlike evolutionary methods, however, they produce these es-
timates while the agent is interacting with its environment and so can take
advantage of the details of individual behavioral interactions. Methods like
this, called policy gradient methods, have proven useful in many problems, and
some of the simplest reinforcement learning methods fall into this category. In
fact, some of these methods take advantage of value function estimates to im-
prove their gradient estimates. Overall, the distinction between policy gradient
methods and other methods we include as reinforcement learning methods is
not sharply deﬁned.

Reinforcement learning’s connection to optimization methods deserves some
additional comment because it is a source of a common misunderstanding.
When we say that a reinforcement learning agent’s goal is to maximize a nu-
merical reward signal, we of course are not insisting that the agent has to
actually achieve the goal of maximum reward. Trying to maximize a quantity
does not mean that that quantity is ever maximized. The point is that a re-
inforcement learning agent is always trying to increase the amount of reward
it receives. Many factors can prevent it from achieving the maximum, even if
one exists. In other words, optimization is not the same a optimality.

1.5 An Extended Example: Tic-Tac-Toe

To illustrate the general idea of reinforcement learning and contrast it with
other approaches, we next consider a single example in more detail.

Consider the familiar child’s game of tic-tac-toe. Two players take turns
playing on a three-by-three board. One player plays Xs and the other Os until
one player wins by placing three marks in a row, horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally, as the X player has in this game:

If the board ﬁlls up with neither player getting three in a row, the game is
a draw. Because a skilled player can play so as never to lose, let us assume
that we are playing against an imperfect player, one whose play is sometimes

XXXOOXO1.5. AN EXTENDED EXAMPLE: TIC-TAC-TOE

11

incorrect and allows us to win. For the moment, in fact, let us consider draws
and losses to be equally bad for us. How might we construct a player that will
ﬁnd the imperfections in its opponent’s play and learn to maximize its chances
of winning?

Although this is a simple problem, it cannot readily be solved in a satisfac-
tory way through classical techniques. For example, the classical “minimax”
solution from game theory is not correct here because it assumes a particular
way of playing by the opponent. For example, a minimax player would never
reach a game state from which it could lose, even if in fact it always won from
that state because of incorrect play by the opponent. Classical optimization
methods for sequential decision problems, such as dynamic programming, can
compute an optimal solution for any opponent, but require as input a com-
plete speciﬁcation of that opponent, including the probabilities with which
the opponent makes each move in each board state. Let us assume that this
information is not available a priori for this problem, as it is not for the vast
majority of problems of practical interest. On the other hand, such informa-
tion can be estimated from experience, in this case by playing many games
against the opponent. About the best one can do on this problem is ﬁrst to
learn a model of the opponent’s behavior, up to some level of conﬁdence, and
then apply dynamic programming to compute an optimal solution given the
approximate opponent model. In the end, this is not that diﬀerent from some
of the reinforcement learning methods we examine later in this book.

An evolutionary method applied to this problem would directly search the
space of possible policies for one with a high probability of winning against
the opponent. Here, a policy is a rule that tells the player what move to make
for every state of the game—every possible conﬁguration of Xs and Os on the
three-by-three board. For each policy considered, an estimate of its winning
probability would be obtained by playing some number of games against the
opponent. This evaluation would then direct which policy or policies were
considered next. A typical evolutionary method would hill-climb in policy
space, successively generating and evaluating policies in an attempt to obtain
incremental improvements. Or, perhaps, a genetic-style algorithm could be
used that would maintain and evaluate a population of policies. Literally
hundreds of diﬀerent optimization methods could be applied.

Here is how the tic-tac-toe problem would be approached with a method
making use of a value function. First we set up a table of numbers, one for
each possible state of the game. Each number will be the latest estimate of
the probability of our winning from that state. We treat this estimate as the
state’s value, and the whole table is the learned value function. State A has
higher value than state B, or is considered “better” than state B, if the current
estimate of the probability of our winning from A is higher than it is from B.

12

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

Figure 1.1: A sequence of tic-tac-toe moves. The solid lines represent the
moves taken during a game; the dashed lines represent moves that we (our
reinforcement learning player) considered but did not make. Our second move
was an exploratory move, meaning that it was taken even though another
sibling move, the one leading to e∗, was ranked higher. Exploratory moves do
not result in any learning, but each of our other moves does, causing backups
as suggested by the curved arrows and detailed in the text.

Assuming we always play Xs, then for all states with three Xs in a row the
probability of winning is 1, because we have already won. Similarly, for all
states with three Os in a row, or that are “ﬁlled up,” the correct probability
is 0, as we cannot win from them. We set the initial values of all the other
states to 0.5, representing a guess that we have a 50% chance of winning.

We play many games against the opponent. To select our moves we examine
the states that would result from each of our possible moves (one for each blank
space on the board) and look up their current values in the table. Most of the
time we move greedily, selecting the move that leads to the state with greatest
value, that is, with the highest estimated probability of winning. Occasionally,
however, we select randomly from among the other moves instead. These are
called exploratory moves because they cause us to experience states that we
might otherwise never see. A sequence of moves made and considered during
a game can be diagrammed as in Figure 1.1.

..•our move{opponent's move{our move{starting position•••abc*dee*opponent's move{c•f•g*gopponent's move{our move{.•1.5. AN EXTENDED EXAMPLE: TIC-TAC-TOE

13

While we are playing, we change the values of the states in which we ﬁnd
ourselves during the game. We attempt to make them more accurate estimates
of the probabilities of winning. To do this, we “back up” the value of the state
after each greedy move to the state before the move, as suggested by the arrows
in Figure 1.1. More precisely, the current value of the earlier state is adjusted
to be closer to the value of the later state. This can be done by moving the
earlier state’s value a fraction of the way toward the value of the later state.
If we let s denote the state before the greedy move, and s(cid:48) the state after
the move, then the update to the estimated value of s, denoted V (s), can be
written as

V (s)

←

V (s) + α

V (s(cid:48))

V (s)

,

(cid:104)

−

(cid:105)

where α is a small positive fraction called the step-size parameter, which in-
ﬂuences the rate of learning. This update rule is an example of a temporal-
diﬀerence learning method, so called because its changes are based on a dif-
ference, V (s(cid:48))

V (s), between estimates at two diﬀerent times.

−

The method described above performs quite well on this task. For example,
if the step-size parameter is reduced properly over time, this method converges,
for any ﬁxed opponent, to the true probabilities of winning from each state
given optimal play by our player. Furthermore, the moves then taken (except
on exploratory moves) are in fact the optimal moves against the opponent. In
other words, the method converges to an optimal policy for playing the game.
If the step-size parameter is not reduced all the way to zero over time, then
this player also plays well against opponents that slowly change their way of
playing.

This example illustrates the diﬀerences between evolutionary methods and
the methods that learn value functions. To evaluate a policy an evolutionary
method holds the policy ﬁxed and plays many games against the opponent, or
simulate many games using a model of the opponent. The frequency of wins
gives an unbiased estimate of the probability of winning with that policy, and
can be used to direct the next policy selection. But each policy change is made
only after many games, and only the ﬁnal outcome of each game is used: what
happens during the games is ignored. For example, if the player wins, then
all of its behavior in the game is given credit, independently of how speciﬁc
moves might have been critical to the win. Credit is even given to moves that
never occurred! Value function methods, in contrast, allow individual states
to be evaluated. In the end, evolutionary and value function methods both
search the space of policies, but learning a value function takes advantage of
information available during the course of play.

This simple example illustrates some of the key features of reinforcement
learning methods. First, there is the emphasis on learning while interacting

14

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

with an environment, in this case with an opponent player. Second, there is a
clear goal, and correct behavior requires planning or foresight that takes into
account delayed eﬀects of one’s choices. For example, the simple reinforce-
ment learning player would learn to set up multi-move traps for a shortsighted
opponent. It is a striking feature of the reinforcement learning solution that it
can achieve the eﬀects of planning and lookahead without using a model of the
opponent and without conducting an explicit search over possible sequences
of future states and actions.

While this example illustrates some of the key features of reinforcement
learning, it is so simple that it might give the impression that reinforcement
learning is more limited than it really is. Although tic-tac-toe is a two-person
game, reinforcement learning also applies in the case in which there is no exter-
nal adversary, that is, in the case of a “game against nature.” Reinforcement
learning also is not restricted to problems in which behavior breaks down into
separate episodes, like the separate games of tic-tac-toe, with reward only at
the end of each episode. It is just as applicable when behavior continues indef-
initely and when rewards of various magnitudes can be received at any time.
Reinforcement learning is also applicable to problems that do not even break
down into discrete time steps, like the plays of tic-tac-toe. The general princi-
ples apply to continuous-time problems as well, although the theory gets more
complicated and we omit it from this introductory treatment.

Tic-tac-toe has a relatively small, ﬁnite state set, whereas reinforcement
learning can be used when the state set is very large, or even inﬁnite. For
example, Gerry Tesauro (1992, 1995) combined the algorithm described above
with an artiﬁcial neural network to learn to play backgammon, which has
approximately 1020 states. With this many states it is impossible ever to
experience more than a small fraction of them. Tesauro’s program learned to
play far better than any previous program, and now plays at the level of the
world’s best human players (see Chapter 15). The neural network provides
the program with the ability to generalize from its experience, so that in new
states it selects moves based on information saved from similar states faced
in the past, as determined by its network. How well a reinforcement learning
system can work in problems with such large state sets is intimately tied to
how appropriately it can generalize from past experience. It is in this role that
we have the greatest need for supervised learning methods with reinforcement
learning. Neural networks are not the only, or necessarily the best, way to do
this.

In this tic-tac-toe example, learning started with no prior knowledge be-
yond the rules of the game, but reinforcement learning by no means entails a
tabula rasa view of learning and intelligence. On the contrary, prior informa-
tion can be incorporated into reinforcement learning in a variety of ways that

1.6. SUMMARY

15

can be critical for eﬃcient learning. We also had access to the true state in the
tic-tac-toe example, whereas reinforcement learning can also be applied when
part of the state is hidden, or when diﬀerent states appear to the learner to be
the same. That case, however, is substantially more diﬃcult, and we do not
cover it signiﬁcantly in this book.

Finally, the tic-tac-toe player was able to look ahead and know the states
that would result from each of its possible moves. To do this, it had to have
a model of the game that allowed it to “think about” how its environment
would change in response to moves that it might never make. Many problems
are like this, but in others even a short-term model of the eﬀects of actions
is lacking. Reinforcement learning can be applied in either case. No model is
required, but models can easily be used if they are available or can be learned.

On the other hand, there are reinforcement learning methods that do not
need any kind of environment model at all. Model-free systems cannot even
think about how their environments will change in response to a single action.
The tic-tac-toe player is model-free in this sense with respect to its opponent:
it has no model of its opponent of any kind. Because models have to be
reasonably accurate to be useful, model-free methods can have advantages over
more complex methods when the real bottleneck in solving a problem is the
diﬃculty of constructing a suﬃciently accurate environment model. Model-
free methods are also important building blocks for model-based methods. In
this book we devote several chapters to model-free methods before we discuss
how they can be used as components of more complex model-based methods.

But reinforcement learning can be used at both high and low levels in a sys-
tem. Although the tic-tac-toe player learned only about the basic moves of the
game, nothing prevents reinforcement learning from working at higher levels
where each of the “actions” may itself be the application of a possibly elabo-
rate problem-solving method. In hierarchical learning systems, reinforcement
learning can work simultaneously on several levels.

1.6 Summary

Reinforcement learning is a computational approach to understanding and au-
tomating goal-directed learning and decision-making. It is distinguished from
other computational approaches by its emphasis on learning by an agent from
direct interaction with its environment, without relying on exemplary super-
vision or complete models of the environment. In our opinion, reinforcement
learning is the ﬁrst ﬁeld to seriously address the computational issues that
arise when learning from interaction with an environment in order to achieve

16

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

long-term goals.

Reinforcement learning uses a formal framework deﬁning the interaction
between a learning agent and its environment in terms of states, actions, and
rewards. This framework is intended to be a simple way of representing es-
sential features of the artiﬁcial intelligence problem. These features include a
sense of cause and eﬀect, a sense of uncertainty and nondeterminism, and the
existence of explicit goals.

The concepts of value and value functions are the key features of most of
the reinforcement learning methods that we consider in this book. We take
the position that value functions are important for eﬃcient search in the space
of policies. Their use of value functions distinguishes reinforcement learning
methods from evolutionary methods that search directly in policy space guided
by scalar evaluations of entire policies.

1.7 History of Reinforcement Learning

The history of reinforcement learning has two main threads, both long and rich,
that were pursued independently before intertwining in modern reinforcement
learning. One thread concerns learning by trial and error that started in the
psychology of animal learning. This thread runs through some of the earliest
work in artiﬁcial intelligence and led to the revival of reinforcement learning in
the early 1980s. The other thread concerns the problem of optimal control and
its solution using value functions and dynamic programming. For the most
part, this thread did not involve learning. Although the two threads have
been largely independent, the exceptions revolve around a third, less distinct
thread concerning temporal-diﬀerence methods such as used in the tic-tac-toe
example in this chapter. All three threads came together in the late 1980s
to produce the modern ﬁeld of reinforcement learning as we present it in this
book.

The thread focusing on trial-and-error learning is the one with which we
are most familiar and about which we have the most to say in this brief history.
Before doing that, however, we brieﬂy discuss the optimal control thread.

The term “optimal control” came into use in the late 1950s to describe
the problem of designing a controller to minimize a measure of a dynamical
system’s behavior over time. One of the approaches to this problem was de-
veloped in the mid-1950s by Richard Bellman and others through extending
a nineteenth century theory of Hamilton and Jacobi. This approach uses the
concepts of a dynamical system’s state and of a value function, or “optimal
return function,” to deﬁne a functional equation, now often called the Bell-

1.7. HISTORY OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

17

man equation. The class of methods for solving optimal control problems by
solving this equation came to be known as dynamic programming (Bellman,
1957a). Bellman (1957b) also introduced the discrete stochastic version of the
optimal control problem known as Markovian decision processes (MDPs), and
Ronald Howard (1960) devised the policy iteration method for MDPs. All of
these are essential elements underlying the theory and algorithms of modern
reinforcement learning.

Dynamic programming is widely considered the only feasible way of solv-
It suﬀers from what Bell-
ing general stochastic optimal control problems.
man called “the curse of dimensionality,” meaning that its computational
requirements grow exponentially with the number of state variables, but it
is still far more eﬃcient and more widely applicable than any other general
method. Dynamic programming has been extensively developed since the
late 1950s, including extensions to partially observable MDPs (surveyed by
Lovejoy, 1991), many applications (surveyed by White, 1985, 1988, 1993), ap-
proximation methods (surveyed by Rust, 1996), and asynchronous methods
(Bertsekas, 1982, 1983). Many excellent modern treatments of dynamic pro-
gramming are available (e.g., Bertsekas, 1995; Puterman, 1994; Ross, 1983;
and Whittle, 1982, 1983). Bryson (1996) provides an authoritative history of
optimal control.

Connections between optimal control and dynamic programming, on the
one hand, and learning, on the other, were slow to be recognized. We can-
not be sure about what accounted for this separation, but its main cause was
likely the separation between the disciplines involved and their diﬀerent goals.
Also contributing may have been the prevalent view of dynamic programming
as an oﬀ-line computation depending essentially on accurate system models
and analytic solutions to the Bellman equation. Further, the simplest form
of dynamic programming is a computation that proceeds backwards in time,
making it diﬃcult to see how it could be involved in a learning process that
must proceed in a forward direction. Perhaps the ﬁrst to connect optimal con-
trol and dynamic programming with learning was Paul Werbos (1977), who
proposed an approximate approach to dynamic programming that he called
“heuristic dynamic programming.” He later argued for the need for greater
interrelation of dynamic programming and learning methods and its relevance
to understanding neural and cognitive mechanisms (Werbos, 1987). For us
the full integration of dynamic programming methods with on-line learning
did not occur until the work of Chris Watkins in 1989, whose treatment of
reinforcement learning using the MDP formalism has been widely adopted
(Watkins, 1989). Since then these relationships have been extensively devel-
oped by many researchers, most particularly by Dimitri Bertsekas and John
Tsitsiklis (1996), who coined the term “neurodynamic programming” to refer

18

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

to the combination of dynamic programming and neural networks. Another
term currently in use is “approximate dynamic programming.” These various
approaches emphasize diﬀerent aspects of the subject, but they all share with
reinforcement learning an interest in circumventing the classical shortcomings
of dynamic programming.

In this book, we consider all of the work in optimal control also to be,
in a sense, work in reinforcement learning. We deﬁne a reinforcement learn-
ing method as any eﬀective way of solving reinforcement learning problems,
and it is now clear that these problems are closely related to optimal con-
trol problems, particularly stochastic optimal control problems such as those
formulated as MDPs. Accordingly, we must consider the solution methods
of optimal control, such as dynamic programming, also to be reinforcement
learning methods. Because almost all of the conventional methods require
complete knowledge of the system to be controlled, it feels a little unnatural
to say that they are part of reinforcement learning. On the other hand, many
dynamic programming algorithms are incremental and iterative. Like learning
methods, they gradually reach the correct answer through successive approx-
imations. As we show in the rest of this book, these similarities are far more
than superﬁcial. The theories and solution methods for the cases of complete
and incomplete knowledge are so closely related that we feel they must be
considered together as part of the same subject matter.

Let us return now to the other major thread leading to the modern ﬁeld of
reinforcement learning, that centered on the idea of trial-and-error learning.
We only touch on the major points of contact here, taking up this topic in more
detail in Chapter ??. According to American psychologist R. S. Woodworth
the idea of trial-and-error learning goes as far back as the 1850s to Alexander
Bain’s discussion of learning by “groping and experiment” and more explicitly
to the British ethologist and psychologist Conway Lloyd Morgan’s 1894 use of
the term to describe his observations of animal behavior (Woodworth, 1938).
Perhaps the ﬁrst to succinctly express the essence of trial-and-error learning
as a principle of learning was Edward Thorndike:

Of several responses made to the same situation, those which are
accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the animal will,
other things being equal, be more ﬁrmly connected with the sit-
uation, so that, when it recurs, they will be more likely to recur;
those which are accompanied or closely followed by discomfort to
the animal will, other things being equal, have their connections
with that situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will be
less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the
greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond. (Thorndike,
1911, p. 244)

1.7. HISTORY OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

19

Thorndike called this the “Law of Eﬀect” because it describes the eﬀect of
reinforcing events on the tendency to select actions. Thorndike later modiﬁed
the law to better account for accumulating data on animal learning (such as
diﬀerences between the eﬀects of reward and punishment), and the law in its
various forms has generated considerable controversy among learning theorists
(e.g., see Gallistel, 2005; Herrnstein, 1970; Kimble, 1961, 1967; Mazur, 1994).
Despite this, the Law of Eﬀect—in one form or another—is widely regarded
as a basic principle underlying much behavior (e.g., Hilgard and Bower, 1975;
Dennett, 1978; Campbell, 1960; Cziko, 1995). It is the basis of the inﬂuential
learning theories of Clark Hull and experimental methods of B. F. Skinner
(e.g., Hull, 1943; Skinner, 1938).

The term “reinforcement” in the context of animal learning came into use
well after Thorndike’s expression of the Law of Eﬀect, to the best of our knowl-
edge ﬁrst appearing in this context in the 1927 English translation of Pavlov’s
monograph on conditioned reﬂexes. Reinforcement is the strengthening of a
pattern of behavior as a result of an animal receiving a stimulus—a reinforcer—
in an appropriate temporal relationship with another stimulus or with a re-
sponse. Some psychologists extended its meaning to include the process of
weakening in addition to strengthening, as well applying when the omission or
termination of an event changes behavior. Reinforcement produces changes in
behavior that persist after the reinforcer is withdrawn, so that a stimulus that
attracts an animal’s attention or that energizes its behavior without producing
lasting changes is not considered to be a reinforcer.

The idea of implementing trial-and-error learning in a computer appeared
among the earliest thoughts about the possibility of artiﬁcial intelligence. In a
1948 report, Alan Turing described a design for a “pleasure-pain system” that
worked along the lines of the Law of Eﬀect:

When a conﬁguration is reached for which the action is undeter-
mined, a random choice for the missing data is made and the appro-
priate entry is made in the description, tentatively, and is applied.
When a pain stimulus occurs all tentative entries are cancelled,
and when a pleasure stimulus occurs they are all made permanent.
(Turing, 1948)

In 1952 Claude Shannon demonstrated a maze-running mouse named Theseus
that used trial and error to ﬁnd its way to a goal location in a maze, with
the maze itself remembering the successful directions via magnets and relays
under its ﬂoor (Shannon, 1952). Other early computational investigations of
trial-and-error learning were those of Minsky and of Farley and Clark, both
in 1954. In his Ph.D. dissertation, Minsky discussed computational models of
reinforcement learning and described his construction of an analog machine

20

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

composed of components he called SNARCs (Stochastic Neural-Analog Rein-
forcement Calculators). Farley and Clark described another neural-network
learning machine designed to learn by trial and error. In the 1960s the terms
“reinforcement” and “reinforcement learning” were used in the engineering lit-
erature for the ﬁrst time (e.g., Waltz and Fu, 1965; Mendel, 1966; Fu, 1970;
Mendel and McClaren, 1970). Particularly inﬂuential was Minsky’s paper
“Steps Toward Artiﬁcial Intelligence” (Minsky, 1961), which discussed several
issues relevant to reinforcement learning, including what he called the credit
assignment problem: How do you distribute credit for success among the many
decisions that may have been involved in producing it? All of the methods we
discuss in this book are, in a sense, directed toward solving this problem.

The interests of Farley and Clark (1954; Clark and Farley, 1955) shifted
from trial-and-error learning to generalization and pattern recognition, that
is, from reinforcement learning to supervised learning. This began a pattern
of confusion about the relationship between these types of learning. Many
researchers seemed to believe that they were studying reinforcement learning
when they were actually studying supervised learning. For example, neural
network pioneers such as Rosenblatt (1962) and Widrow and Hoﬀ (1960) were
clearly motivated by reinforcement learning—they used the language of re-
wards and punishments—but the systems they studied were supervised learn-
ing systems suitable for pattern recognition and perceptual learning. Even to-
day, some researchers and textbooks minimize or blur the distinction between
these types of learning. For example, some neural-network textbooks have
used the term “trial-and-error” to describe networks that learn from training
examples. This is an understandable confusion because these networks use
error information to update connection weights, but this substantially misses
the essential selectional character of trial-and-error learning.

Partly as a result of these confusions, research into genuine trial-and-error
learning became rare in the the 1960s and 1970s. In the next few paragraphs
we discuss some of the exceptions and partial exceptions to this trend.

One of these was the work by a New Zealand researcher named John An-
dreae. Andreae (1963) developed a system called STeLLA that learned by trial
and error in interaction with its environment. This system included an internal
model of the world and, later, an “internal monologue” to deal with problems
of hidden state (Andreae, 1969a). Andreae’s later work (1977) placed more
emphasis on learning from a teacher, but still included trial and error. Un-
fortunately, his pioneering research was not well known, and did not greatly
impact subsequent reinforcement learning research.

More inﬂuential was the work of Donald Michie.

In 1961 and 1963 he
described a simple trial-and-error learning system for learning how to play

1.7. HISTORY OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

21

tic-tac-toe (or naughts and crosses) called MENACE (for Matchbox Educable
Naughts and Crosses Engine). It consisted of a matchbox for each possible
game position, each matchbox containing a number of colored beads, a dif-
ferent color for each possible move from that position. By drawing a bead at
random from the matchbox corresponding to the current game position, one
could determine MENACE’s move. When a game was over, beads were added
to or removed from the boxes used during play to reinforce or punish MEN-
ACE’s decisions. Michie and Chambers (1968) described another tic-tac-toe
reinforcement learner called GLEE (Game Learning Expectimaxing Engine)
and a reinforcement learning controller called BOXES. They applied BOXES
to the task of learning to balance a pole hinged to a movable cart on the basis
of a failure signal occurring only when the pole fell or the cart reached the end
of a track. This task was adapted from the earlier work of Widrow and Smith
(1964), who used supervised learning methods, assuming instruction from a
teacher already able to balance the pole. Michie and Chambers’s version of
pole-balancing is one of the best early examples of a reinforcement learning
task under conditions of incomplete knowledge. It inﬂuenced much later work
in reinforcement learning, beginning with some of our own studies (Barto,
Sutton, and Anderson, 1983; Sutton, 1984). Michie has consistently empha-
sized the role of trial and error and learning as essential aspects of artiﬁcial
intelligence (Michie, 1974).

Widrow, Gupta, and Maitra (1973) modiﬁed the Least-Mean-Square (LMS)
algorithm of Widrow and Hoﬀ (1960) to produce a reinforcement learning rule
that could learn from success and failure signals instead of from training exam-
ples. They called this form of learning “selective bootstrap adaptation” and
described it as “learning with a critic” instead of “learning with a teacher.”
They analyzed this rule and showed how it could learn to play blackjack. This
was an isolated foray into reinforcement learning by Widrow, whose contribu-
tions to supervised learning were much more inﬂuential. Our use of the term
“critic” is derived from Widrow, Gupta, and Maitra’s paper.

Research on learning automata had a more direct inﬂuence on the trial-
and-error thread leading to modern reinforcement learning research. These
are methods for solving a nonassociative, purely selectional learning problem
known as the n-armed bandit by analogy to a slot machine, or “one-armed
bandit,” except with n levers (see Chapter 2). Learning automata are simple,
low-memory machines for improving the probability of reward in these prob-
lems. Learning automata originated with work in the 1960s of the Russian
mathematician and physicist M. L. Tsetlin and colleagues (published posthu-
mously in Tsetlin, 1973) and has been extensively developed since then within
engineering (see Narendra and Thathachar, 1974, 1989). These developments
included the study of stochastic learning automata, which are methods for up-

22

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

dating action probabilities on the basis of reward signals. Stochastic learning
automata were foreshadowed by earlier work in psychology, beginning with
William Estes’ 1950 eﬀort toward a statistical theory of learning (Estes, 1950)
and further developed by others, most famously by psychologist Robert Bush
and statistician Frederick Mosteller (Bush and Mosteller, 1955).

The statistical learning theories developed in psychology were adopted by
researchers in economics, leading to a thread of research in that ﬁeld devoted to
reinforcement learning. This work began in 1973 with the application of Bush
and Mosteller’s learning theory to a collection of classical economic models
(Cross, 1973). One goal of this research was to study artiﬁcial agents that act
more like real people than do traditional idealized economic agents (Arthur,
1991). This approach expanded to the study of reinforcement learning in the
context of game theory. Although reinforcement learning in economics de-
veloped largely independently of the early work in artiﬁcial intelligence, rein-
forcement learning and game theory is a topic of current interest in both ﬁelds,
but one that is beyond the scope of this book. Camerer (2003) discusses the
reinforcement learning tradition in economics, and Now´e et al. (2012) provide
an overview of the subject from the point of view of multi-agent extensions
to the approach that we introduce in this book. Reinforcement learning and
game theory is a much diﬀerent subject from reinforcement learning used in
programs to play tic-tac-toe, checkers, and other recreational games. See, for
example, Szita (2012) for an overview of this aspect of reinforcement learning
and games.

John Holland (1975) outlined a general theory of adaptive systems based
on selectional principles. His early work concerned trial and error primarily in
its nonassociative form, as in evolutionary methods and the n-armed bandit.
In 1986 he introduced classiﬁer systems, true reinforcement learning systems
including association and value functions. A key component of Holland’s clas-
siﬁer systems was always a genetic algorithm, an evolutionary method whose
role was to evolve useful representations. Classiﬁer systems have been exten-
sively developed by many researchers to form a major branch of reinforcement
learning research (reviewed by Urbanowicz and Moore, 2009), but genetic
algorithms—which we do not consider to be reinforcement learning systems
by themselves—have received much more attention, as have other approaches
to evolutionary computation (e.g., Fogel, Owens and Walsh, 1966, and Koza,
1992).

The individual most responsible for reviving the trial-and-error thread to
reinforcement learning within artiﬁcial intelligence was Harry Klopf (1972,
1975, 1982). Klopf recognized that essential aspects of adaptive behavior
were being lost as learning researchers came to focus almost exclusively on
supervised learning. What was missing, according to Klopf, were the hedonic

1.7. HISTORY OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

23

aspects of behavior, the drive to achieve some result from the environment, to
control the environment toward desired ends and away from undesired ends.
This is the essential idea of trial-and-error learning. Klopf’s ideas were espe-
cially inﬂuential on the authors because our assessment of them (Barto and
Sutton, 1981a) led to our appreciation of the distinction between supervised
and reinforcement learning, and to our eventual focus on reinforcement learn-
ing. Much of the early work that we and colleagues accomplished was directed
toward showing that reinforcement learning and supervised learning were in-
deed diﬀerent (Barto, Sutton, and Brouwer, 1981; Barto and Sutton, 1981b;
Barto and Anandan, 1985). Other studies showed how reinforcement learning
could address important problems in neural network learning, in particular,
how it could produce learning algorithms for multilayer networks (Barto, An-
derson, and Sutton, 1982; Barto and Anderson, 1985; Barto and Anandan,
1985; Barto, 1985, 1986; Barto and Jordan, 1987). We say more about the
reinforcement learning and neural networks in Chapter Y.

We turn now to the third thread to the history of reinforcement learn-
ing, that concerning temporal-diﬀerence learning. Temporal-diﬀerence learn-
ing methods are distinctive in being driven by the diﬀerence between tempo-
rally successive estimates of the same quantity—for example, of the probability
of winning in the tic-tac-toe example. This thread is smaller and less distinct
than the other two, but it has played a particularly important role in the ﬁeld,
in part because temporal-diﬀerence methods seem to be new and unique to
reinforcement learning.

The origins of temporal-diﬀerence learning are in part in animal learning
psychology, in particular, in the notion of secondary reinforcers. A secondary
reinforcer is a stimulus that has been paired with a primary reinforcer such as
food or pain and, as a result, has come to take on similar reinforcing proper-
ties. Minsky (1954) may have been the ﬁrst to realize that this psychological
principle could be important for artiﬁcial learning systems. Arthur Samuel
(1959) was the ﬁrst to propose and implement a learning method that included
temporal-diﬀerence ideas, as part of his celebrated checkers-playing program.

Samuel made no reference to Minsky’s work or to possible connections
to animal learning. His inspiration apparently came from Claude Shannon’s
(1950) suggestion that a computer could be programmed to use an evalua-
tion function to play chess, and that it might be able to improve its play by
modifying this function on-line. (It is possible that these ideas of Shannon’s
also inﬂuenced Bellman, but we know of no evidence for this.) Minsky (1961)
extensively discussed Samuel’s work in his “Steps” paper, suggesting the con-
nection to secondary reinforcement theories, both natural and artiﬁcial.

As we have discussed, in the decade following the work of Minsky and

24

CHAPTER 1. THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

Samuel, little computational work was done on trial-and-error learning, and
apparently no computational work at all was done on temporal-diﬀerence
learning.
In 1972, Klopf brought trial-and-error learning together with an
important component of temporal-diﬀerence learning. Klopf was interested
in principles that would scale to learning in large systems, and thus was in-
trigued by notions of local reinforcement, whereby subcomponents of an overall
learning system could reinforce one another. He developed the idea of “gen-
eralized reinforcement,” whereby every component (nominally, every neuron)
views all of its inputs in reinforcement terms: excitatory inputs as rewards
and inhibitory inputs as punishments. This is not the same idea as what we
now know as temporal-diﬀerence learning, and in retrospect it is farther from
it than was Samuel’s work. On the other hand, Klopf linked the idea with
trial-and-error learning and related it to the massive empirical database of
animal learning psychology.

Sutton (1978a, 1978b, 1978c) developed Klopf’s ideas further, particu-
larly the links to animal learning theories, describing learning rules driven
by changes in temporally successive predictions. He and Barto reﬁned these
ideas and developed a psychological model of classical conditioning based on
temporal-diﬀerence learning (Sutton and Barto, 1981a; Barto and Sutton,
1982). There followed several other inﬂuential psychological models of classical
conditioning based on temporal-diﬀerence learning (e.g., Klopf, 1988; Moore
et al., 1986; Sutton and Barto, 1987, 1990). Some neuroscience models devel-
oped at this time are well interpreted in terms of temporal-diﬀerence learning
(Hawkins and Kandel, 1984; Byrne, Gingrich, and Baxter, 1990; Gelperin,
Hopﬁeld, and Tank, 1985; Tesauro, 1986; Friston et al., 1994), although in
most cases there was no historical connection.

Our early work on temporal-diﬀerence learning was strongly inﬂuenced
by animal learning theories and by Klopf’s work. Relationships to Minsky’s
“Steps” paper and to Samuel’s checkers players appear to have been recognized
only afterward. By 1981, however, we were fully aware of all the prior work
mentioned above as part of the temporal-diﬀerence and trial-and-error threads.
At this time we developed a method for using temporal-diﬀerence learning in
trial-and-error learning, known as the actor–critic architecture, and applied
this method to Michie and Chambers’s pole-balancing problem (Barto, Sutton,
and Anderson, 1983). This method was extensively studied in Sutton’s (1984)
Ph.D. dissertation and extended to use backpropagation neural networks in
Anderson’s (1986) Ph.D. dissertation. Around this time, Holland (1986) incor-
porated temporal-diﬀerence ideas explicitly into his classiﬁer systems. A key
step was taken by Sutton in 1988 by separating temporal-diﬀerence learning
from control, treating it as a general prediction method. That paper also in-
troduced the TD(λ) algorithm and proved some of its convergence properties.

1.8. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REMARKS

25

As we were ﬁnalizing our work on the actor–critic architecture in 1981, we
discovered a paper by Ian Witten (1977) that contains the earliest known pub-
lication of a temporal-diﬀerence learning rule. He proposed the method that
we now call tabular TD(0) for use as part of an adaptive controller for solving
MDPs. Witten’s work was a descendant of Andreae’s early experiments with
STeLLA and other trial-and-error learning systems. Thus, Witten’s 1977 pa-
per spanned both major threads of reinforcement learning research—trial-and-
error learning and optimal control—while making a distinct early contribution
to temporal-diﬀerence learning.

The temporal-diﬀerence and optimal control threads were fully brought
together in 1989 with Chris Watkins’s development of Q-learning. This work
extended and integrated prior work in all three threads of reinforcement learn-
ing research. Paul Werbos (1987) contributed to this integration by arguing
for the convergence of trial-and-error learning and dynamic programming since
1977. By the time of Watkins’s work there had been tremendous growth in
reinforcement learning research, primarily in the machine learning subﬁeld
of artiﬁcial intelligence, but also in neural networks and artiﬁcial intelligence
more broadly. In 1992, the remarkable success of Gerry Tesauro’s backgammon
playing program, TD-Gammon, brought additional attention to the ﬁeld.

In the time since publication of the ﬁrst edition of this book, a ﬂourishing
subﬁeld of neuroscience developed that focuses on the relationship between
reinforcement learning algorithms and reinforcement learning in the nervous
system. Most responsible for this is an uncanny similarity between the behav-
ior of temporal-diﬀerence algorithms and the activity of dopamine producing
neurons in the brain, as pointed out by a number of researchers (Friston et
al., 1994; Barto, 1995a; Houk, Adams, and Barto, 1995; Montague, Dayan,
and Sejnowski, 1996; and Schultz, Dayan, and Montague,1997). Chapter Y
provides is an introduction to this exciting aspect of reinforcement leaning.

Other important contributions made in the recent history of reinforcement
learning are too numerous to mention in this brief account; we cite many these
at the end of the individual chapters in which they arise.

1.8 Bibliographical Remarks

For additional general coverage of reinforcement learning, we refer the reader to
the books by Szepesv´ari (2010), Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996), and Kaelbling
(1993a). Books that take a control or operation research perspective are those
of Si et al. (2004), Powell (2011), and Lewis and Liu (2012). Two special
issues of the journal Machine Learning focus on reinforcement learning: Sutton

Exercises

Exercise 1.1: Self-Play
Suppose, instead of playing against a random
opponent, the reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against
itself. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a diﬀerent
way of playing?

Exercise 1.2: Symmetries Many tic-tac-toe positions appear diﬀerent but
are really the same because of symmetries. How might we amend the reinforce-
ment learning algorithm described above to take advantage of this? In what
ways would this improve it? Now think again. Suppose the opponent did not
take advantage of symmetries. In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that
symmetrically equivalent positions should necessarily have the same value?

Exercise 1.3: Greedy Play Suppose the reinforcement learning player was
greedy, that is, it always played the move that brought it to the position that
it rated the best. Would it learn to play better, or worse, than a nongreedy
player? What problems might occur?

Exercise 1.4: Learning from Exploration Suppose learning updates occurred
If the step-size parameter is
after all moves, including exploratory moves.
appropriately reduced over time, then the state values would converge to a
set of probabilities. What are the two sets of probabilities computed when we
do, and when we do not, learn from exploratory moves? Assuming that we
do continue to make exploratory moves, which set of probabilities might be
better to learn? Which would result in more wins?

Exercise 1.5: Other Improvements Can you think of other ways to improve
the reinforcement learning player? Can you think of any better way to solve
the tic-tac-toe problem as posed?

Tabular Solution Methods

27

29

In this part of the book we describe almost all the core ideas of reinforce-
ment learning algorithms in their simplest forms, that in which the state and
action spaces are small enough for the approximate action-value function to be
represented as an array, or table. In this case, the methods can often ﬁnd exact
solutions, that is, they can often ﬁnd exactly the optimal value function and
the optimal policy. This contrasts with the approximate methods described in
the next part of the book, which only ﬁnd approximate solutions, but which
in return can be applied eﬀectively to much larger problems.

The ﬁrst chapter of this part of the book describes solution methods for
the special of the reinforcement learning problem in which there is only a
single state, called bandit problems. The second chapter describes the general
problem formulation that we treat throughout the rest of the book—ﬁnite
markov decision processes—and its main ideas including Bellman equations
and value functions.

The next three chapters describe three fundamental classes of methods
for solving ﬁnite Markov decision problems: dynamic programming, Monte
Carlo methods, and temporal-diﬀerence learning. Each class of methods has
its strengths and weaknesses. Dynamic programming methods are well de-
veloped mathematically, but require a complete and accurate model of the
environment. Monte Carlo methods don’t require a model and are concep-
tually simple, but are not suited for step-by-step incremental computation.
Finally, temporal-diﬀerence methods require no model and are fully incremen-
tal, but are more complex to analyze. The methods also diﬀer in several ways
with respect to their eﬃciency and speed of convergence.

The remaining two chapters describe how these three classes of methods
can be combined to obtain the best features of each of them. In one chapter we
describe how the strengths of Monte Carlo methods can be combined with the
strengths of temporal-diﬀerence methods via the use of eligibility traces. In
the ﬁnal chapter of this part of the book we show these two learning methods
can be combined with model learning and planning methods (such as dynamic
programming) for a complete and uniﬁed solution to the tabular reinforcement
learning problem.

Multi-arm Bandits

The most important feature distinguishing reinforcement learning from other
types of learning is that it uses training information that evaluates the actions
taken rather than instructs by giving correct actions. This is what creates
the need for active exploration, for an explicit trial-and-error search for good
behavior. Purely evaluative feedback indicates how good the action taken is,
but not whether it is the best or the worst action possible. Evaluative feed-
back is the basis of methods for function optimization, including evolutionary
methods. Purely instructive feedback, on the other hand, indicates the cor-
rect action to take, independently of the action actually taken. This kind
of feedback is the basis of supervised learning, which includes large parts of
pattern classiﬁcation, artiﬁcial neural networks, and system identiﬁcation. In
their pure forms, these two kinds of feedback are quite distinct: evaluative
feedback depends entirely on the action taken, whereas instructive feedback is
independent of the action taken. There are also interesting intermediate cases
in which evaluation and instruction blend together.

In this chapter we study the evaluative aspect of reinforcement learning in
a simpliﬁed setting, one that does not involve learning to act in more than
one situation. This nonassociative setting is the one in which most prior
work involving evaluative feedback has been done, and it avoids much of the
complexity of the full reinforcement learning problem. Studying this case will
enable us to see most clearly how evaluative feedback diﬀers from, and yet can
be combined with, instructive feedback.

The particular nonassociative, evaluative feedback problem that we explore
is a simple version of the n-armed bandit problem. We use this problem to
introduce a number of basic learning methods which we extend in later chapters
to apply to the full reinforcement learning problem. At the end of this chapter,
we take a step closer to the full reinforcement learning problem by discussing

31

32

CHAPTER 2. MULTI-ARM BANDITS

what happens when the bandit problem becomes associative, that is, when
actions are taken in more than one situation.

2.1 An n-Armed Bandit Problem

Consider the following learning problem. You are faced repeatedly with a
choice among n diﬀerent options, or actions. After each choice you receive a
numerical reward chosen from a stationary probability distribution that de-
pends on the action you selected. Your objective is to maximize the expected
total reward over some time period, for example, over 1000 action selections,
or time steps.

This is the original form of the n-armed bandit problem, so named by anal-
ogy to a slot machine, or “one-armed bandit,” except that it has n levers
instead of one. Each action selection is like a play of one of the slot machine’s
levers, and the rewards are the payoﬀs for hitting the jackpot. Through re-
peated action selections you are to maximize your winnings by concentrating
your actions on the best levers. Another analogy is that of a doctor choosing
between experimental treatments for a series of seriously ill patients. Each
action selection is a treatment selection, and each reward is the survival or
well-being of the patient. Today the term “n-armed bandit problem” is some-
times used for a generalization of the problem described above, but in this
book we use it to refer just to this simple case.

In our n-armed bandit problem, each action has an expected or mean
reward given that that action is selected; let us call this the value of that
action. If you knew the value of each action, then it would be trivial to solve
the n-armed bandit problem: you would always select the action with highest
value. We assume that you do not know the action values with certainty,
although you may have estimates.

If you maintain estimates of the action values, then at any time step there
is at least one action whose estimated value is greatest. We call this a greedy
action.
If you select a greedy action, we say that you are exploiting your
current knowledge of the values of the actions. If instead you select one of
the nongreedy actions, then we say you are exploring, because this enables
you to improve your estimate of the nongreedy action’s value. Exploitation is
the right thing to do to maximize the expected reward on the one step, but
exploration may produce the greater total reward in the long run. For example,
suppose the greedy action’s value is known with certainty, while several other
actions are estimated to be nearly as good but with substantial uncertainty.
The uncertainty is such that at least one of these other actions probably is

2.2. ACTION-VALUE METHODS

33

actually better than the greedy action, but you don’t know which one.
If
you have many time steps ahead on which to make action selections, then it
may be better to explore the nongreedy actions and discover which of them
are better than the greedy action. Reward is lower in the short run, during
exploration, but higher in the long run because after you have discovered the
better actions, you can exploit them many times. Because it is not possible
both to explore and to exploit with any single action selection, one often refers
to the “conﬂict” between exploration and exploitation.

In any speciﬁc case, whether it is better to explore or exploit depends in a
complex way on the precise values of the estimates, uncertainties, and the num-
ber of remaining steps. There are many sophisticated methods for balancing
exploration and exploitation for particular mathematical formulations of the
n-armed bandit and related problems. However, most of these methods make
strong assumptions about stationarity and prior knowledge that are either
violated or impossible to verify in applications and in the full reinforcement
learning problem that we consider in subsequent chapters. The guarantees of
optimality or bounded loss for these methods are of little comfort when the
assumptions of their theory do not apply.

In this book we do not worry about balancing exploration and exploitation
in a sophisticated way; we worry only about balancing them at all. In this
chapter we present several simple balancing methods for the n-armed bandit
problem and show that they work much better than methods that always
exploit.
The need to balance exploration and exploitation is a distinctive
challenge that arises in reinforcement learning; the simplicity of the n-armed
bandit problem enables us to show this in a particularly clear form.

2.2 Action-Value Methods

We begin by looking more closely at some simple methods for estimating the
values of actions and for using the estimates to make action selection decisions.
In this chapter, we denote the true (actual) value of action a as q(a), and the
estimated value on the tth time step as Qt(a). Recall that the true value of an
action is the mean reward received when that action is selected. One natural
way to estimate this is by averaging the rewards actually received when the
action was selected. In other words, if by the tth time step action a has been
chosen Nt(a) times prior to t, yielding rewards R1, R2, . . . , RNt(a), then its value
is estimated to be

Qt(a) =

R1 + R2 +

· · ·
Nt(a)

+ RNt(a)

.

(2.1)

34

CHAPTER 2. MULTI-ARM BANDITS

→ ∞

If Nt(a) = 0, then we deﬁne Qt(a) instead as some default value, such as
, by the law of large numbers, Qt(a) converges
Q1(a) = 0. As Nt(a)
to q(a). We call this the sample-average method for estimating action values
because each estimate is a simple average of the sample of relevant rewards.
Of course this is just one way to estimate action values, and not necessarily
the best one. Nevertheless, for now let us stay with this simple estimation
method and turn to the question of how the estimates might be used to select
actions.

The simplest action selection rule is to select the action (or one of the
actions) with highest estimated action value, that is, to select at step t one
of the greedy actions, A∗t , for which Qt(A∗t ) = maxa Qt(a). This greedy action
selection method can be written as

At = argmax

a

Qt(a),

(2.2)

where argmaxa denotes the value of a at which the expression that follows
is maximized (with ties broken arbitrarily). Greedy action selection always
exploits current knowledge to maximize immediate reward; it spends no time
at all sampling apparently inferior actions to see if they might really be bet-
ter. A simple alternative is to behave greedily most of the time, but every
once in a while, say with small probability ε, instead to select randomly from
amongst all the actions with equal probability independently of the action-
value estimates. We call methods using this near-greedy action selection rule
ε-greedy methods. An advantage of these methods is that, in the limit as the
number of plays increases, every action will be sampled an inﬁnite number
of times, guaranteeing that Nt(a)
for all a, and thus ensuring that all
→ ∞
the Qt(a) converge to q(a). This of course implies that the probability of se-
ε, that is, to near
lecting the optimal action converges to greater than 1
certainty. These are just asymptotic guarantees, however, and say little about
the practical eﬀectiveness of the methods.

−

To roughly assess the relative eﬀectiveness of the greedy and ε-greedy meth-
ods, we compared them numerically on a suite of test problems. This was a
set of 2000 randomly generated n-armed bandit tasks with n = 10. For each
bandit, the action values, q(a), a = 1, . . . , 10, were selected according to a
normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. On tth time step
with a given bandit, the actual reward Rt was the q(At) for the bandit (where
At was the action selected) plus a normally distributed noise term that was
mean 0 and variance 1. Averaging over bandits, we can plot the performance
and behavior of various methods as they improve with experience over 1000
steps, as in Figure 2.1. We call this suite of test tasks the 10-armed testbed.

Figure 2.1 compares a greedy method with two ε-greedy methods (ε = 0.01
and ε = 0.1), as described above, on the 10-armed testbed. Both methods

10-armed testbed. These data are averages over 2000 tasks. All methods
used sample averages as their action-value estimates. The detailed structure
at the beginning of these curves depends on how actions are selected when
multiple actions have the same maximal action value. Here such ties were
broken randomly. An alternative that has a similar eﬀect is to add a very
small amount of randomness to each of the initial action values, so that ties
eﬀectively never happen.

CHAPTER 2. MULTI-ARM BANDITS

formed their action-value estimates using the sample-average technique. The
upper graph shows the increase in expected reward with experience. The
greedy method improved slightly faster than the other methods at the very
beginning, but then leveled oﬀ at a lower level. It achieved a reward per step of
only about 1, compared with the best possible of about 1.55 on this testbed.
The greedy method performs signiﬁcantly worse in the long run because it
often gets stuck performing suboptimal actions. The lower graph shows that
the greedy method found the optimal action in only approximately one-third of
the tasks. In the other two-thirds, its initial samples of the optimal action were
disappointing, and it never returned to it. The ε-greedy methods eventually
perform better because they continue to explore, and to improve their chances
of recognizing the optimal action. The ε = 0.1 method explores more, and
usually ﬁnds the optimal action earlier, but never selects it more than 91%
of the time. The ε = 0.01 method improves more slowly, but eventually
performs better than the ε = 0.1 method on both performance measures. It
is also possible to reduce ε over time to try to get the best of both high and
low values.

The advantage of ε-greedy over greedy methods depends on the task. For
example, suppose the reward variance had been larger, say 10 instead of 1.
With noisier rewards it takes more exploration to ﬁnd the optimal action, and
ε-greedy methods should fare even better relative to the greedy method. On
the other hand, if the reward variances were zero, then the greedy method
would know the true value of each action after trying it once. In this case the
greedy method might actually perform best because it would soon ﬁnd the
optimal action and then never explore. But even in the deterministic case,
there is a large advantage to exploring if we weaken some of the other as-
sumptions. For example, suppose the bandit task were nonstationary, that is,
that the true values of the actions changed over time. In this case exploration
is needed even in the deterministic case to make sure one of the nongreedy
actions has not changed to become better than the greedy one. As we will see
in the next few chapters, eﬀective nonstationarity is the case most commonly
encountered in reinforcement learning. Even if the underlying task is station-
ary and deterministic, the learner faces a set of banditlike decision tasks each
of which changes over time due to the learning process itself. Reinforcement
learning requires a balance between exploration and exploitation.

2.3

Incremental Implementation

The action-value methods we have discussed so far all estimate action values
as sample averages of observed rewards. The obvious implementation is to

2.3.

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION

37

maintain, for each action a, a record of all the rewards that have followed the
selection of that action. Then, when the estimate of the value of action a is
needed at time t, it can be computed according to (2.1), which we repeat here:

Qt(a) =

R1 + R2 +

· · ·
Nt(a)

+ RNt(a)

,

where here R1, . . . , RNt(a) are all the rewards received following all selections of
action a prior to play t. A problem with this straightforward implementation
is that its memory and computational requirements grow over time without
bound. That is, each additional reward following a selection of action a re-
quires more memory to store it and results in more computation being required
to determine Qt(a).

As you might suspect, this is not really necessary. It is easy to devise in-
cremental update formulas for computing averages with small, constant com-
putation required to process each new reward. For some action, let Qk denote
the estimate for its kth reward, that is, the average of its ﬁrst k
1 rewards.
Given this average and a kth reward for the action, Rk, then the average of
all k rewards can be computed by

which holds even for k = 1, obtaining Q2 = R1 for arbitrary Q1. This imple-
mentation requires memory only for Qk and k, and only the small computation
(2.3) for each new reward.

The update rule (2.3) is of a form that occurs frequently throughout this

book. The general form is

indicate a desirable direction in which to move, though it may be noisy. In
the case above, for example, the target is the kth reward.

Note that the step-size parameter (StepSize) used in the incremental
method described above changes from time step to time step.
In process-
ing the kth reward for action a, that method uses a step-size parameter of
1
k . In this book we denote the step-size parameter by the symbol α or, more
generally, by αt(a). We sometimes use the informal shorthand α = 1
k to refer
to this case, leaving the dependence of k on the action implicit.

2.4 Tracking a Nonstationary Problem

The averaging methods discussed so far are appropriate in a stationary envi-
ronment, but not if the bandit is changing over time. As noted earlier, we
often encounter reinforcement learning problems that are eﬀectively nonsta-
tionary. In such cases it makes sense to weight recent rewards more heavily
than long-past ones. One of the most popular ways of doing this is to use a
constant step-size parameter. For example, the incremental update rule (2.3)
for updating an average Qk of the k

1 past rewards is modiﬁed to be

−

Qk+1 = Qk + α

Sometimes it is convenient to vary the step-size parameter from step to
step. Let αk(a) denote the step-size parameter used to process the reward
received after the kth selection of action a. As we have noted, the choice
αk(a) = 1
k results in the sample-average method, which is guaranteed to con-
verge to the true action values by the law of large numbers. But of course

Note that both convergence conditions are met for the sample-average case,
αk(a) = 1
k , but not for the case of constant step-size parameter, αk(a) = α. In
the latter case, the second condition is not met, indicating that the estimates
never completely converge but continue to vary in response to the most re-
cently received rewards. As we mentioned above, this is actually desirable in
a nonstationary environment, and problems that are eﬀectively nonstationary

parameters that meet the conditions (2.7) often converge very slowly or need
considerable tuning in order to obtain a satisfactory convergence rate. Al-
though sequences of step-size parameters that meet these convergence condi-
tions are often used in theoretical work, they are seldom used in applications
and empirical research.

2.5 Optimistic Initial Values

All the methods we have discussed so far are dependent to some extent on
the initial action-value estimates, Q1(a). In the language of statistics, these
methods are biased by their initial estimates. For the sample-average methods,

40

CHAPTER 2. MULTI-ARM BANDITS

Figure 2.2: The eﬀect of optimistic initial action-value estimates on the 10-
armed testbed. Both methods used a constant step-size parameter, α = 0.1.

the bias disappears once all actions have been selected at least once, but for
methods with constant α, the bias is permanent, though decreasing over time
as given by (2.6). In practice, this kind of bias is usually not a problem, and
can sometimes be very helpful. The downside is that the initial estimates
become, in eﬀect, a set of parameters that must be picked by the user, if only
to set them all to zero. The upside is that they provide an easy way to supply
some prior knowledge about what level of rewards can be expected.

Initial action values can also be used as a simple way of encouraging ex-
ploration. Suppose that instead of setting the initial action values to zero, as
we did in the 10-armed testbed, we set them all to +5. Recall that the q(a)
in this problem are selected from a normal distribution with mean 0 and vari-
ance 1. An initial estimate of +5 is thus wildly optimistic. But this optimism
encourages action-value methods to explore. Whichever actions are initially
selected, the reward is less than the starting estimates; the learner switches
to other actions, being “disappointed” with the rewards it is receiving. The
result is that all actions are tried several times before the value estimates con-
verge. The system does a fair amount of exploration even if greedy actions are
selected all the time.

Figure 2.2 shows the performance on the 10-armed bandit testbed of a
greedy method using Q1(a) = +5, for all a. For comparison, also shown is an
ε-greedy method with Q1(a) = 0. Initially, the optimistic method performs
worse because it explores more, but eventually it performs better because its
exploration decreases with time. We call this technique for encouraging ex-
ploration optimistic initial values. We regard it as a simple trick that can be
quite eﬀective on stationary problems, but it is far from being a generally use-
ful approach to encouraging exploration. For example, it is not well suited to

nonstationary problems because its drive for exploration is inherently tempo-
rary. If the task changes, creating a renewed need for exploration, this method
cannot help. Indeed, any method that focuses on the initial state in any special
way is unlikely to help with the general nonstationary case. The beginning
of time occurs only once, and thus we should not focus on it too much. This
criticism applies as well to the sample-average methods, which also treat the
beginning of time as a special event, averaging all subsequent rewards with
equal weights. Nevertheless, all of these methods are very simple, and one of
them or some simple combination of them is often adequate in practice. In the
rest of this book we make frequent use of several of these simple exploration
techniques.

2.6 Upper-Conﬁdence-Bound Action Selection

Exploration is needed because the estimates of the action values are uncertain.
The greedy actions are those that look best at present, but some of the other
actions may actually be better. ε-greedy action selection forces the non-greedy
actions to be tried, but indiscriminately, with no preference for those that are
nearly greedy or particularly uncertain. It would be better to select among
the non-greedy actions according to their potential for actually being optimal,
taking into account both how close their estimates are to being maximal and
the uncertainties in those estimates. One eﬀective way of doing this is to select
actions as

At = argmax

a

(cid:34)

Qt(a) + c

ln t
Nt(a) (cid:35)

,

(cid:115)

(2.8)

where ln t denotes the natural logarithm of t (the number that e
2.71828
would have to be raised to in order to equal t), and the number c > 0 controls
the degree of exploration. If Nt(a) = 0, then a is considered to be a maximizing
action.

≈

The idea of this upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) action selection is that the
square-root term is a measure of the uncertainty or variance in the estimate
of a’s value. The quantity being max’ed over is thus a sort of upper bound
on the possible true value of action a, with the c parameter determining the
conﬁdence level. Each time a is selected the uncertainty is presumably reduced;
Nt(a) is incremented and, as it appears in the denominator of the uncertainty
term, the term is decreased. On the other hand, each time an action other a is
selected t is increased; as it appears in the numerator the uncertainty estimate
is increased. The use of the natural logarithm means that the increase gets
smaller over time, but is unbounded; all actions will eventually be selected, but

CHAPTER 2. MULTI-ARM BANDITS

Figure 2.3: Average performance of UCB action selection on the 10-armed
testbed. As shown, UCB generally performs better that ε-greedy action selec-
tion, except in the ﬁrst n plays, when it selects randomly among the as-yet-
unplayed actions. UCB with c = 1 would perform even better but would not
show the prominent spike in performance on the 11th play. Can you think of
an explanation of this spike?

as time goes by it will be a longer wait, and thus a lower selection frequency,
for actions with a lower value estimate or that have already been selected more
times.

Results with UCB on the 10-armed testbed are shown in Figure 2.3. UCB
will often perform well, as shown here, but is more diﬃcult than ε-greedy
to extend beyond bandits to the more general reinforcement learning settings
considered in the rest of this book. One diﬃculty is in dealing with nonsta-
tionary problems; something more complex than the methods presented in
Section 2.4 would be needed. Another diﬃculty is dealing with large state
spaces, particularly function approximation as developed in Part III of this
book. In these more advanced settings there is currently no known practical
way of utilizing the idea of UCB action selection.

2.7 Gradient Bandits

So far in this chapter we have considered methods that estimate action values
and use those estimates to select actions. This is often a good approach,
but it is not the only one possible.
In this section we consider learning a
numerical preference Ht(a) for each action a. The larger the preference, the

𝜀-greedy  𝜀 = 0.1UCB  c = 2AveragerewardSteps2.7. GRADIENT BANDITS

43

more often that action is taken, but the preference has no interpretation in
terms of reward. Only the relative preference of one action over another is
important; if we add 1000 to all the preferences there is no aﬀect on the action
probabilities, which are determined according to a soft-max distribution (i.e.,
Gibbs or Boltzmann distribution) as follows:

At = a
Pr
{

}

=

eHt(a))
b=1 eHt(b) = πt(a),
n

(2.9)

where here we have also introduced a useful new notation πt(a) for the proba-
bility of taking action a at time t. Initially all preferences are the same (e.g.,
a) so that all actions have an equal probability of being selected.
H1(a) = 0,

(cid:80)

∀

There is a natural learning algorithm for this setting based on the idea
of stochastic gradient ascent. On each step, after selecting the action At and
receiving the reward Rt, the preferences are updated by:

πt(At)

,

and

where α > 0 is a step-size parameter, and ¯Rt ∈
R is the average of all the
rewards up through and including time t, which can be computed incrementally
as described in Section 2.3 (or Section 2.4 if the problem is nonstationary).
The ¯Rt term serves as a baseline with which the reward is compared. If the
reward is higher than the baseline, then the probability of taking At in the
future is increased, and if the reward is below baseline, then probability is
decreased. The non-selected actions move in the opposite direction.

∀

Figure 2.4 shows results with the gradient-bandit algorithm on a variant
of the 10-armed testbed in which the true expected rewards were selected
according to a normal distribution with a mean of +4 instead of zero (and with
unit variance as before). This shifting up of all the rewards has absolutely no
aﬀect on the gradient-bandit algorithm because of the reward baseline term,
which instantaneously adapts to the new level. But if the baseline were omitted
(that is, if ¯Rt was taken to be constant zero in (2.10)), then performance would
be signiﬁcantly degraded, as shown in the ﬁgure.

One can gain a deeper insight into this algorithm by understanding it as
a stochastic approximation to gradient ascent. In exact gradient ascent, each
preference Ht(a) would be incrementing proportional to the increment’s eﬀect
on performance:

Ht+1(a) = Ht(a) + α

∂ E [Rt]
∂Ht(a)

,

(2.11)

where the measure of performance here is the expected reward:

E[Rt] =

πt(b)q(b).

(cid:88)b

(cid:54)
44

CHAPTER 2. MULTI-ARM BANDITS

Figure 2.4: Average performance of the gradient-bandit algorithm with and
without a reward baseline on the 10-armed testbed with E[q(a)] = 4.

Of course, it is not possible to implement gradient ascent exactly in our case
because by assumption we do not know the q(b), but in fact the updates of our
algorithm (2.10) are equal to (2.11) in expected value, making the algorithm
an instance of stochastic gradient ascent.

The calculations showing this require only beginning calculus, but take
several steps. If you are mathematically inclined, then you will enjoy the rest
of this section in which we go through these steps. First we take a closer look
at the exact performance gradient:

because the gradient sums to zero over the all the actions,
Ht(a) is changed, some actions’ probabilities go up and some down, but the
sum of the changes must be zero because the sum of the probabilities must

We have just shown that the expected update of the gradient-bandit algo-
rithm is equal to the gradient of expected reward, and thus that the algorithm
is an instance of stochastic gradient ascent. This assures us that the algorithm
has robust convergence properties.

Note that we did not require anything of the reward baseline other than
that it not depend on the selected action. For example, we could have set
is to zero, or to 1000, and the algorithm would still have been an instance
of stochastic gradient ascent. The choice of the baseline does not aﬀect the
expected update of the algorithm, but it does aﬀect the variance of the update
and thus the rate of convergence (as shown, e.g., in Figure 2.4). Choosing it
as the average of the rewards may not be the very best, but it is simple and
works well in practice.

2.8 Associative Search (Contextual Bandits)

So far in this chapter we have considered only nonassociative tasks, in which
there is no need to associate diﬀerent actions with diﬀerent situations.
In
these tasks the learner either tries to ﬁnd a single best action when the task is
stationary, or tries to track the best action as it changes over time when the
task is nonstationary. However, in a general reinforcement learning task there
is more than one situation, and the goal is to learn a policy: a mapping from
situations to the actions that are best in those situations. To set the stage for

2.9. SUMMARY

47

the full problem, we brieﬂy discuss the simplest way in which nonassociative
tasks extend to the associative setting.

As an example, suppose there are several diﬀerent n-armed bandit tasks,
and that on each play you confront one of these chosen at random. Thus, the
bandit task changes randomly from play to play. This would appear to you as
a single, nonstationary n-armed bandit task whose true action values change
randomly from play to play. You could try using one of the methods described
in this chapter that can handle nonstationarity, but unless the true action
values change slowly, these methods will not work very well. Now suppose,
however, that when a bandit task is selected for you, you are given some
distinctive clue about its identity (but not its action values). Maybe you are
facing an actual slot machine that changes the color of its display as it changes
its action values. Now you can learn a policy associating each task, signaled
by the color you see, with the best action to take when facing that task—for
instance, if red, play arm 1; if green, play arm 2. With the right policy you
can usually do much better than you could in the absence of any information
distinguishing one bandit task from another.

This is an example of an associative search task, so called because it in-
volves both trial-and-error learning in the form of search for the best actions
and association of these actions with the situations in which they are best.2
Associative search tasks are intermediate between the n-armed bandit problem
and the full reinforcement learning problem. They are like the full reinforce-
ment learning problem in that they involve learning a policy, but like our
version of the n-armed bandit problem in that each action aﬀects only the
immediate reward. If actions are allowed to aﬀect the next situation as well as
the reward, then we have the full reinforcement learning problem. We present
this problem in the next chapter and consider its ramiﬁcations throughout the
rest of the book.

2.9 Summary

We have presented in this chapter several simple ways of balancing exploration
and exploitation. The ε-greedy methods choose randomly a small fraction of
the time, whereas UCB methods choose deterministically but achieve explo-
ration by subtly favoring at each step the actions that have so far received fewer
samples. Gradient-bandit algorithms estimate not action values, but action
preferences, and favor the more preferred actions in a graded, probabalistic
manner using a soft-max distribution. The simple expedient of initializing

2Associative search tasks are often now termed contextual bandits in the literature.

this chapter. Each point is the average reward obtained over 1000 steps with
a particular algorithm at a particular setting of its parameter.

estimates optimistically causes even greedy methods to explore signiﬁcantly.

It is natural to ask which of these methods is best. Although this is a
diﬃcult question to answer in general, we can certainly run them all on the
10-armed testbed that we have used throughout this chapter and compare
their performances. A complication is that they all have a parameter; to
get a meaningful comparison we will have to consider their performance as
a function of their parameter. Our graphs so far have shown the course of
learning over time for each algorithm and parameter setting, but it would
be too visually confusing to show such a learning curve for each algorithm
and parameter value. Instead we summarize a complete learning curve by its
average value over the 1000 steps; this value is proportional to the area under
the learning curves we have shown up to now. Figure 2.5 shows this measure
for the various bandit algorithms from this chapter, each as a function of its
own parameter shown on a single scale on the x-axis. Note that the parameter
values are varied by factors of two and presented on a log scale. Note also
the characteristic inverted-U shapes of each algorithm’s performance; all the
algorithms perform best at an intermediate value of their parameter, neither
too large nor too big. In assessing an method, we should attend not just to
how well it does at its best parameter setting, but also to how sensitive it is to
its parameter value. All of these algorithms are fairly insensitive, performing
well over a range of parameter values varying by about an order of magnitude.
Overall, on this problem, UCB seems to perform best.

49

Despite their simplicity, in our opinion the methods presented in this chap-
ter can fairly be considered the state of the art. There are more sophisticated
methods, but their complexity and assumptions make them impractical for the
full reinforcement learning problem that is our real focus. Starting in Chap-
ter 5 we present learning methods for solving the full reinforcement learning
problem that use in part the simple methods explored in this chapter.

Although the simple methods explored in this chapter may be the best we
can do at present, they are far from a fully satisfactory solution to the problem
of balancing exploration and exploitation.

The classical solution to balancing exploration and exploitation in n-armed
bandit problems is to compute special functions called Gittins indices. These
provide an optimal solution to a certain kind of bandit problem more general
than that considered here but that assumes the prior distribution of possible
problems is known. Unfortunately, neither the theory nor the computational
tractability of this method appear to generalize to the full reinforcement learn-
ing problem that we consider in the rest of the book.

There is also a well-known algorithm for computing the Bayes optimal way
to balance exploration and exploitation. This method is computationally in-
tractable when done exactly, but there may be eﬃcient ways to approximate it.
In this method we assume that we know the distribution of problem instances,
that is, the probability of each possible set of true action values. Given any
action selection, we can then compute the probability of each possible imme-
diate reward and the resultant posterior probability distribution over action
values. This evolving distribution becomes the information state of the prob-
lem. Given a horizon, say 1000 plays, one can consider all possible actions, all
possible resulting rewards, all possible next actions, all next rewards, and so
on for all 1000 plays. Given the assumptions, the rewards and probabilities
of each possible chain of events can be determined, and one need only pick
the best. But the tree of possibilities grows extremely rapidly; even if there
are only two actions and two rewards, the tree will have 22000 leaves. This
approach eﬀectively turns the bandit problem into an instance of the full rein-
forcement learning problem. In the end, we may be able to use reinforcement
learning methods to approximate this optimal solution. But that is a topic for
current research and beyond the scope of this book.

Robbins (1952), and studied by Bellman (1956). Berry and Fristedt
(1985) provide an extensive treatment of bandit problems from the
perspective of statistics. Narendra and Thathachar (1989) treat bandit
problems from the engineering perspective, providing a good discussion
of the various theoretical traditions that have focused on them. In psy-
chology, bandit problems have played roles in statistical learning theory
(e.g., Bush and Mosteller, 1955; Estes, 1950).

The term greedy is often used in the heuristic search literature (e.g.,
Pearl, 1984). The conﬂict between exploration and exploitation is
known in control engineering as the conﬂict between identiﬁcation (or
estimation) and control (e.g., Witten, 1976). Feldbaum (1965) called it
the dual control problem, referring to the need to solve the two prob-
lems of identiﬁcation and control simultaneously when trying to control
a system under uncertainty. In discussing aspects of genetic algorithms,
Holland (1975) emphasized the importance of this conﬂict, referring to
it as the conﬂict between the need to exploit and the need for new
information.

2.2

Action-value methods for our n-armed bandit problem were ﬁrst pro-
posed by Thathachar and Sastry (1985). These are often called esti-
mator algorithms in the learning automata literature. The term action
value is due to Watkins (1989). The ﬁrst to use ε-greedy methods may
also have been Watkins (1989, p. 187), but the idea is so simple that
some earlier use seems likely.

2.3–4 This material falls under the general heading of stochastic iterative

algorithms, which is well covered by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996).

Optimistic initialization was used in reinforcement learning by Sutton
(1996).

Early work on using estimates of the upper conﬁdence bound to select
actions was done by Lai and Robbins (1985), Kaelbling (1993b), and
Agarwal (1995). The UCB algorithm we present here is called UCB1
in the literature and was ﬁrst developed by Auer, Cesa-Bianchi and
Fischer (2002).

Gradient-bandit algorithms are a special case of the gradient-based
reinforcement learning algorithms introduced by Williams (1992), and
that later developed into the actor–critic and policy-gradient algorithms
that we treat later in this book. Further discussion of the choice of

baseline is provided there and by Greensmith, Bartlett, and Baxter
(2001, 2004) and Dick (2015).

The term softmax for the action selection rule (2.9) is due to Bridle
(1990). This rule appears to have been ﬁrst proposed by Luce (1959).

The term associative search and the corresponding problem were in-
troduced by Barto, Sutton, and Brouwer (1981). The term associative
reinforcement learning has also been used for associative search (Barto
and Anandan, 1985), but we prefer to reserve that term as a synonym
for the full reinforcement learning problem (as in Sutton, 1984). (And,
as we noted, the modern literature also uses the term “contextual ban-
dits” for this problem.) We note that Thorndike’s Law of Eﬀect (quoted
in Chapter 1) describes associative search by referring to the formation
of associative links between situations (states) and actions. Accord-
ing to the terminology of operant, or instrumental, conditioning (e.g.,
Skinner, 1938), a discriminative stimulus is a stimulus that signals the
presence of a particular reinforcement contingency. In our terms, dif-
ferent discriminative stimuli correspond to diﬀerent states.

The Gittins index approach is due to Gittins and Jones (1974). Duﬀ
(1995) showed how it is possible to learn Gittins indices for bandit
problems through reinforcement learning. Bellman (1956) was the ﬁrst
to show how dynamic programming could be used to compute the op-
timal balance between exploration and exploitation within a Bayesian
formulation of the problem. The survey by Kumar (1985) provides
a good discussion of Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches to these
problems. The term information state comes from the literature on
partially observable MDPs; see, e.g., Lovejoy (1991).

Exercises

Exercise 2.1 In the comparison shown in Figure 2.1, which method will
perform best in the long run in terms of cumulative reward and cumulative
probability of selecting the best action? How much better will it be? Express
your answer quantitatively.

Exercise 2.2 Give pseudocode for a complete algorithm for the n-armed
bandit problem. Use greedy action selection and incremental computation of
action values with α = 1

that takes an action and returns a reward. Use arrays and variables; do not

subscript anything by the time index t (for examples of this style of pseu-
docode, see Figures 4.1 and 4.3). Indicate how the action values are initialized
and updated after each reward. Indicate how the step-size parameters are set
for each action as a function of how many times it has been tried.

Exercise 2.3 If the step-size parameters, αk, are not constant, then the esti-
mate Qk is a weighted average of previously received rewards with a weighting
diﬀerent from that given by (2.6). What is the weighting on each prior reward
for the general case, analogous to (2.6), in terms of αk?

Exercise 2.4 (programming) Design and conduct an experiment to demon-
strate the diﬃculties that sample-average methods have for nonstationary
problems. Use a modiﬁed version of the 10-armed testbed in which all the
q(a) start out equal and then take independent random walks. Prepare plots
like Figure 2.1 for an action-value method using sample averages, incremen-
tally computed by α = 1
k , and another action-value method using a constant
step-size parameter, α = 0.1. Use ε = 0.1 and, if necessary, runs longer than
1000 plays.

Exercise 2.5 The results shown in Figure 2.2 should be quite reliable be-
cause they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed ban-
dit tasks. Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of
the curve for the optimistic method? What might make this method perform
particularly better or worse, on average, on particular early plays?

Exercise 2.6 Suppose you face a binary bandit task whose true action values
change randomly from play to play. Speciﬁcally, suppose that for any play the
true values of actions 1 and 2 are respectively 0.1 and 0.2 with probability 0.5
(case A), and 0.9 and 0.8 with probability 0.5 (case B). If you are not able to
tell which case you face at any play, what is the best expectation of success
you can achieve and how should you behave to achieve it? Now suppose that
on each play you are told if you are facing case A or case B (although you still
don’t know the true action values). This is an associative search task. What
is the best expectation of success you can achieve in this task, and how should
you behave to achieve it?

Finite Markov Decision
Processes

In this chapter we introduce the problem that we try to solve in the rest of
the book. For us, this problem deﬁnes the ﬁeld of reinforcement learning: any
method that is suited to solving this problem we consider to be a reinforcement
learning method.

Our objective in this chapter is to describe the reinforcement learning prob-
lem in a broad sense. We try to convey the wide range of possible applications
that can be framed as reinforcement learning tasks. We also describe math-
ematically idealized forms of the reinforcement learning problem for which
precise theoretical statements can be made. We introduce key elements of the
problem’s mathematical structure, such as value functions and Bellman equa-
tions. As in all of artiﬁcial intelligence, there is a tension between breadth of
applicability and mathematical tractability. In this chapter we introduce this
tension and discuss some of the trade-oﬀs and challenges that it implies.

3.1 The Agent–Environment Interface

The reinforcement learning problem is meant to be a straightforward framing
of the problem of learning from interaction to achieve a goal. The learner and
decision-maker is called the agent. The thing it interacts with, comprising
everything outside the agent, is called the environment. These interact con-
tinually, the agent selecting actions and the environment responding to those
actions and presenting new situations to the agent.1 The environment also

1We use the terms agent, environment, and action instead of the engineers’ terms con-
troller, controlled system (or plant), and control signal because they are meaningful to a

gives rise to rewards, special numerical values that the agent tries to maximize
over time. A complete speciﬁcation of an environment deﬁnes a task , one
instance of the reinforcement learning problem.

More speciﬁcally, the agent and environment interact at each of a sequence
of discrete time steps, t = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ..2 At each time step t, the agent receives
S, where S is the set of
some representation of the environment’s state, St ∈
A(St), where A(St)
possible states, and on that basis selects an action, At ∈
is the set of actions available in state St. One time step later, in part as
a consequence of its action, the agent receives a numerical reward , Rt+1 ∈
R, and ﬁnds itself in a new state, St+1.3 Figure 3.1 diagrams the agent–
R
environment interaction.

⊂

At each time step, the agent implements a mapping from states to prob-
abilities of selecting each possible action. This mapping is called the agent’s
policy and is denoted πt, where πt(a
s) is the probability that At = a if St = s.
|
Reinforcement learning methods specify how the agent changes its policy as
a result of its experience. The agent’s goal, roughly speaking, is to maximize
the total amount of reward it receives over the long run.

This framework is abstract and ﬂexible and can be applied to many diﬀerent
problems in many diﬀerent ways. For example, the time steps need not refer
to ﬁxed intervals of real time; they can refer to arbitrary successive stages of
decision-making and acting. The actions can be low-level controls, such as the
voltages applied to the motors of a robot arm, or high-level decisions, such
as whether or not to have lunch or to go to graduate school. Similarly, the
states can take a wide variety of forms. They can be completely determined
by low-level sensations, such as direct sensor readings, or they can be more

wider audience.

2We restrict attention to discrete time to keep things as simple as possible, even though
many of the ideas can be extended to the continuous-time case (e.g., see Bertsekas and
Tsitsiklis, 1996; Werbos, 1992; Doya, 1996).

3We use Rt+1 instead of Rt to denote the reward due to At because it emphasizes that

the next reward and next state, Rt+1 and St+1, are jointly determined.

high-level and abstract, such as symbolic descriptions of objects in a room.
Some of what makes up a state could be based on memory of past sensations
or even be entirely mental or subjective. For example, an agent could be in
the state of not being sure where an object is, or of having just been surprised
in some clearly deﬁned sense. Similarly, some actions might be totally mental
or computational. For example, some actions might control what an agent
chooses to think about, or where it focuses its attention. In general, actions
can be any decisions we want to learn how to make, and the states can be
anything we can know that might be useful in making them.

In particular, the boundary between agent and environment is not often
the same as the physical boundary of a robot’s or animal’s body. Usually, the
boundary is drawn closer to the agent than that. For example, the motors
and mechanical linkages of a robot and its sensing hardware should usually be
considered parts of the environment rather than parts of the agent. Similarly,
if we apply the framework to a person or animal, the muscles, skeleton, and
sensory organs should be considered part of the environment. Rewards, too,
presumably are computed inside the physical bodies of natural and artiﬁcial
learning systems, but are considered external to the agent.

The general rule we follow is that anything that cannot be changed ar-
bitrarily by the agent is considered to be outside of it and thus part of its
environment. We do not assume that everything in the environment is un-
known to the agent. For example, the agent often knows quite a bit about
how its rewards are computed as a function of its actions and the states in
which they are taken. But we always consider the reward computation to be
external to the agent because it deﬁnes the task facing the agent and thus
must be beyond its ability to change arbitrarily. In fact, in some cases the
agent may know everything about how its environment works and still face
a diﬃcult reinforcement learning task, just as we may know exactly how a
puzzle like Rubik’s cube works, but still be unable to solve it. The agent–
environment boundary represents the limit of the agent’s absolute control, not
of its knowledge.

The agent–environment boundary can be located at diﬀerent places for
diﬀerent purposes. In a complicated robot, many diﬀerent agents may be op-
erating at once, each with its own boundary. For example, one agent may make
high-level decisions which form part of the states faced by a lower-level agent
that implements the high-level decisions. In practice, the agent–environment
boundary is determined once one has selected particular states, actions, and
rewards, and thus has identiﬁed a speciﬁc decision-making task of interest.

The reinforcement learning framework is a considerable abstraction of the
problem of goal-directed learning from interaction. It proposes that whatever

56

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

the details of the sensory, memory, and control apparatus, and whatever ob-
jective one is trying to achieve, any problem of learning goal-directed behavior
can be reduced to three signals passing back and forth between an agent and
its environment: one signal to represent the choices made by the agent (the
actions), one signal to represent the basis on which the choices are made (the
states), and one signal to deﬁne the agent’s goal (the rewards). This frame-
work may not be suﬃcient to represent all decision-learning problems usefully,
but it has proved to be widely useful and applicable.

Of course, the particular states and actions vary greatly from task to task,
and how they are represented can strongly aﬀect performance. In reinforce-
ment learning, as in other kinds of learning, such representational choices are at
present more art than science. In this book we oﬀer some advice and examples
regarding good ways of representing states and actions, but our primary focus
is on general principles for learning how to behave once the representations
have been selected.

Example 3.1: Bioreactor Suppose reinforcement learning is being applied
to determine moment-by-moment temperatures and stirring rates for a biore-
actor (a large vat of nutrients and bacteria used to produce useful chemicals).
The actions in such an application might be target temperatures and target
stirring rates that are passed to lower-level control systems that, in turn, di-
rectly activate heating elements and motors to attain the targets. The states
are likely to be thermocouple and other sensory readings, perhaps ﬁltered and
delayed, plus symbolic inputs representing the ingredients in the vat and the
target chemical. The rewards might be moment-by-moment measures of the
rate at which the useful chemical is produced by the bioreactor. Notice that
here each state is a list, or vector, of sensor readings and symbolic inputs,
and each action is a vector consisting of a target temperature and a stirring
rate. It is typical of reinforcement learning tasks to have states and actions
with such structured representations. Rewards, on the other hand, are always
single numbers.

Example 3.2: Pick-and-Place Robot Consider using reinforcement learn-
ing to control the motion of a robot arm in a repetitive pick-and-place task. If
we want to learn movements that are fast and smooth, the learning agent will
have to control the motors directly and have low-latency information about
the current positions and velocities of the mechanical linkages. The actions
in this case might be the voltages applied to each motor at each joint, and
the states might be the latest readings of joint angles and velocities. The
reward might be +1 for each object successfully picked up and placed. To
encourage smooth movements, on each time step a small, negative reward can
be given as a function of the moment-to-moment “jerkiness” of the motion.

3.2. GOALS AND REWARDS

57

Example 3.3: Recycling Robot A mobile robot has the job of collecting
empty soda cans in an oﬃce environment. It has sensors for detecting cans, and
an arm and gripper that can pick them up and place them in an onboard bin; it
runs on a rechargeable battery. The robot’s control system has components for
interpreting sensory information, for navigating, and for controlling the arm
and gripper. High-level decisions about how to search for cans are made by a
reinforcement learning agent based on the current charge level of the battery.
This agent has to decide whether the robot should (1) actively search for a
can for a certain period of time, (2) remain stationary and wait for someone
to bring it a can, or (3) head back to its home base to recharge its battery.
This decision has to be made either periodically or whenever certain events
occur, such as ﬁnding an empty can. The agent therefore has three actions,
and its state is determined by the state of the battery. The rewards might be
zero most of the time, but then become positive when the robot secures an
empty can, or large and negative if the battery runs all the way down. In this
example, the reinforcement learning agent is not the entire robot. The states
it monitors describe conditions within the robot itself, not conditions of the
robot’s external environment. The agent’s environment therefore includes the
rest of the robot, which might contain other complex decision-making systems,
as well as the robot’s external environment.

3.2 Goals and Rewards

In reinforcement learning, the purpose or goal of the agent is formalized in
terms of a special reward signal passing from the environment to the agent.
R. Informally, the
At each time step, the reward is a simple number, Rt ∈
agent’s goal is to maximize the total amount of reward it receives. This means
maximizing not immediate reward, but cumulative reward in the long run. We
can clearly state this informal idea as the reward hypothesis:

That all of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well
thought of as the maximization of the expected value of the cu-
mulative sum of a received scalar signal (called reward).

The use of a reward signal to formalize the idea of a goal is one of the most
distinctive features of reinforcement learning.

Although formulating goals in terms of reward signals might at ﬁrst appear
limiting, in practice it has proved to be ﬂexible and widely applicable. The best
way to see this is to consider examples of how it has been, or could be, used.
For example, to make a robot learn to walk, researchers have provided reward

58

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

on each time step proportional to the robot’s forward motion. In making a
1 for every time
robot learn how to escape from a maze, the reward is often
step that passes prior to escape; this encourages the agent to escape as quickly
as possible. To make a robot learn to ﬁnd and collect empty soda cans for
recycling, one might give it a reward of zero most of the time, and then a
reward of +1 for each can collected. One might also want to give the robot
negative rewards when it bumps into things or when somebody yells at it. For
an agent to learn to play checkers or chess, the natural rewards are +1 for
winning,

1 for losing, and 0 for drawing and for all nonterminal positions.

−

−

You can see what is happening in all of these examples. The agent always
learns to maximize its reward. If we want it to do something for us, we must
provide rewards to it in such a way that in maximizing them the agent will
also achieve our goals.
It is thus critical that the rewards we set up truly
indicate what we want accomplished. In particular, the reward signal is not
the place to impart to the agent prior knowledge about how to achieve what we
want it to do.4 For example, a chess-playing agent should be rewarded only
for actually winning, not for achieving subgoals such taking its opponent’s
pieces or gaining control of the center of the board. If achieving these sorts
of subgoals were rewarded, then the agent might ﬁnd a way to achieve them
without achieving the real goal. For example, it might ﬁnd a way to take the
opponent’s pieces even at the cost of losing the game. The reward signal is
your way of communicating to the robot what you want it to achieve, not how
you want it achieved.

Newcomers to reinforcement learning are sometimes surprised that the
rewards—which deﬁne of the goal of learning—are computed in the environ-
ment rather than in the agent. Certainly most ultimate goals for animals
are recognized by computations occurring inside their bodies, for example, by
sensors for recognizing food, hunger, pain, and pleasure. Nevertheless, as we
discussed in the previous section, one can redraw the agent–environment in-
terface in such a way that these parts of the body are considered to be outside
of the agent (and thus part of the agent’s environment). For example, if the
goal concerns a robot’s internal energy reservoirs, then these are considered to
be part of the environment; if the goal concerns the positions of the robot’s
limbs, then these too are considered to be part of the environment—that is,
the agent’s boundary is drawn at the interface between the limbs and their
control systems. These things are considered internal to the robot but external
to the learning agent. For our purposes, it is convenient to place the boundary
of the learning agent not at the limit of its physical body, but at the limit of

4Better places for imparting this kind of prior knowledge are the initial policy or value
function, or in inﬂuences on these. See Lin (1992), Maclin and Shavlik (1994), and Clouse
(1996).

3.3. RETURNS

its control.

59

The reason we do this is that the agent’s ultimate goal should be something
over which it has imperfect control:
it should not be able, for example, to
simply decree that the reward has been received in the same way that it might
arbitrarily change its actions. Therefore, we place the reward source outside
of the agent. This does not preclude the agent from deﬁning for itself a kind
of internal reward, or a sequence of internal rewards. Indeed, this is exactly
what many reinforcement learning methods do.

3.3 Returns

So far we have discussed the objective of learning informally. We have said that
the agent’s goal is to maximize the cumulative reward it receives in the long
run. How might this be deﬁned formally? If the sequence of rewards received
after time step t is denoted Rt+1, Rt+2, Rt+3, . . ., then what precise aspect of
this sequence do we wish to maximize? In general, we seek to maximize the
expected return, where the return Gt is deﬁned as some speciﬁc function of the
reward sequence. In the simplest case the return is the sum of the rewards:

Gt = Rt+1 + Rt+2 + Rt+3 +

+ RT ,

· · ·

(3.1)

where T is a ﬁnal time step. This approach makes sense in applications in
which there is a natural notion of ﬁnal time step, that is, when the agent–
environment interaction breaks naturally into subsequences, which we call
episodes,5 such as plays of a game, trips through a maze, or any sort of re-
peated interactions. Each episode ends in a special state called the terminal
state, followed by a reset to a standard starting state or to a sample from a
standard distribution of starting states. Tasks with episodes of this kind are
called episodic tasks. In episodic tasks we sometimes need to distinguish the
set of all nonterminal states, denoted S, from the set of all states plus the
terminal state, denoted S+.

On the other hand, in many cases the agent–environment interaction does
not break naturally into identiﬁable episodes, but goes on continually without
limit. For example, this would be the natural way to formulate a continual
process-control task, or an application to a robot with a long life span. We
call these continuing tasks. The return formulation (3.1) is problematic for
continuing tasks because the ﬁnal time step would be T =
, and the return,
which is what we are trying to maximize, could itself easily be inﬁnite. (For
example, suppose the agent receives a reward of +1 at each time step.) Thus,

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

Figure 3.2: The pole-balancing task.

in this book we usually use a deﬁnition of return that is slightly more complex
conceptually but much simpler mathematically.

The additional concept that we need is that of discounting. According to
this approach, the agent tries to select actions so that the sum of the discounted
rewards it receives over the future is maximized. In particular, it chooses At
to maximize the expected discounted return:

The discount rate determines the present value of future rewards: a reward
received k time steps in the future is worth only γk

worth if it were received immediately. If γ < 1, the inﬁnite sum has a ﬁnite

value as long as the reward sequence
{
is “myopic” in being concerned only with maximizing immediate rewards: its
objective in this case is to learn how to choose At so as to maximize only
Rt+1. If each of the agent’s actions happened to inﬂuence only the immediate
reward, not future rewards as well, then a myopic agent could maximize (3.2)
by separately maximizing each immediate reward. But in general, acting to
maximize immediate reward can reduce access to future rewards so that the
return may actually be reduced. As γ approaches 1, the objective takes future
rewards into account more strongly: the agent becomes more farsighted.

Example 3.4: Pole-Balancing Figure 3.2 shows a task that served as an
early illustration of reinforcement learning. The objective here is to apply
forces to a cart moving along a track so as to keep a pole hinged to the cart
from falling over. A failure is said to occur if the pole falls past a given angle
from vertical or if the cart runs oﬀ the track. The pole is reset to vertical
after each failure. This task could be treated as episodic, where the natural
episodes are the repeated attempts to balance the pole. The reward in this

3.4. UNIFIED NOTATION FOR EPISODIC AND CONTINUING TASKS61

case could be +1 for every time step on which failure did not occur, so that the
return at each time would be the number of steps until failure. Alternatively,
we could treat pole-balancing as a continuing task, using discounting. In this
1 on each failure and zero at all other times. The
case the reward would be
γK, where K is the number of
return at each time would then be related to
time steps before failure. In either case, the return is maximized by keeping
the pole balanced for as long as possible.

3.4 Uniﬁed Notation for Episodic and Contin-

uing Tasks

In the preceding section we described two kinds of reinforcement learning tasks,
one in which the agent–environment interaction naturally breaks down into a
sequence of separate episodes (episodic tasks), and one in which it does not
(continuing tasks). The former case is mathematically easier because each
action aﬀects only the ﬁnite number of rewards subsequently received during
the episode.
In this book we consider sometimes one kind of problem and
sometimes the other, but often both. It is therefore useful to establish one
notation that enables us to talk precisely about both cases simultaneously.

To be precise about episodic tasks requires some additional notation. Rather
than one long sequence of time steps, we need to consider a series of episodes,
each of which consists of a ﬁnite sequence of time steps. We number the time
steps of each episode starting anew from zero. Therefore, we have to refer not
just to St, the state representation at time t, but to St,i, the state representa-
tion at time t of episode i (and similarly for At,i, Rt,i, πt,i, Ti, etc.). However,
it turns out that, when we discuss episodic tasks we will almost never have to
distinguish between diﬀerent episodes. We will almost always be considering
a particular single episode, or stating something that is true for all episodes.
Accordingly, in practice we will almost always abuse notation slightly by drop-
ping the explicit reference to episode number. That is, we will write St to refer
to St,i, and so on.

We need one other convention to obtain a single notation that covers both
episodic and continuing tasks. We have deﬁned the return as a sum over a ﬁnite
number of terms in one case (3.1) and as a sum over an inﬁnite number of terms
in the other (3.2). These can be uniﬁed by considering episode termination to
be the entering of a special absorbing state that transitions only to itself and
that generates only rewards of zero. For example, consider the state transition

Here the solid square represents the special absorbing state corresponding
to the end of an episode. Starting from S0, we get the reward sequence
+1, +1, +1, 0, 0, 0, . . .. Summing these, we get the same return whether we
sum over the ﬁrst T rewards (here T = 3) or over the full inﬁnite sequence.
This remains true even if we introduce discounting. Thus, we can deﬁne the
return, in general, according to (3.2), using the convention of omitting episode
numbers when they are not needed, and including the possibility that γ = 1 if
the sum remains deﬁned (e.g., because all episodes terminate). Alternatively,
we can also write the return as

or γ = 1 (but not both6). We use these
including the possibility that T =
conventions throughout the rest of the book to simplify notation and to express
the close parallels between episodic and continuing tasks.

∗3.5 The Markov Property

In the reinforcement learning framework, the agent makes its decisions as a
function of a signal from the environment called the environment’s state. In
this section we discuss what is required of the state signal, and what kind of
information we should and should not expect it to provide. In particular, we
formally deﬁne a property of environments and their state signals that is of
particular interest, called the Markov property.

In this book, by “the state” we mean whatever information is available to
the agent. We assume that the state is given by some preprocessing system
that is nominally part of the environment. We do not address the issues of
constructing, changing, or learning the state signal in this book. We take this
approach not because we consider state representation to be unimportant, but

6Ways to formulate tasks that are both continuing and undiscounted are the subject of
current research (e.g., Mahadevan, 1996; Schwartz, 1993; Tadepalli and Ok, 1994). Some of
the ideas are discussed in Section 11.2.

in order to focus fully on the decision-making issues. In other words, our main
concern is not with designing the state signal, but with deciding what action
to take as a function of whatever state signal is available.

Certainly the state signal should include immediate sensations such as sen-
sory measurements, but it can contain much more than that. State represen-
tations can be highly processed versions of original sensations, or they can be
complex structures built up over time from the sequence of sensations. For ex-
ample, we can move our eyes over a scene, with only a tiny spot corresponding
to the fovea visible in detail at any one time, yet build up a rich and detailed
representation of a scene. Or, more obviously, we can look at an object, then
look away, and know that it is still there. We can hear the word “yes” and
consider ourselves to be in totally diﬀerent states depending on the question
that came before and which is no longer audible. At a more mundane level, a
control system can measure position at two diﬀerent times to produce a state
representation including information about velocity. In all of these cases the
state is constructed and maintained on the basis of immediate sensations to-
gether with the previous state or some other memory of past sensations. In
this book, we do not explore how that is done, but certainly it can be and has
been done. There is no reason to restrict the state representation to immediate
sensations; in typical applications we should expect the state representation
to be able to inform the agent of more than that.

On the other hand, the state signal should not be expected to inform the
agent of everything about the environment, or even everything that would be
useful to it in making decisions. If the agent is playing blackjack, we should not
expect it to know what the next card in the deck is. If the agent is answering
the phone, we should not expect it to know in advance who the caller is. If
the agent is a paramedic called to a road accident, we should not expect it
to know immediately the internal injuries of an unconscious victim.
In all
of these cases there is hidden state information in the environment, and that
information would be useful if the agent knew it, but the agent cannot know it
because it has never received any relevant sensations. In short, we don’t fault
an agent for not knowing something that matters, but only for having known
something and then forgotten it!

What we would like, ideally, is a state signal that summarizes past sensa-
tions compactly, yet in such a way that all relevant information is retained.
This normally requires more than the immediate sensations, but never more
than the complete history of all past sensations. A state signal that suc-
ceeds in retaining all relevant information is said to be Markov, or to have
the Markov property (we deﬁne this formally below). For example, a check-
ers position—the current conﬁguration of all the pieces on the board—would
serve as a Markov state because it summarizes everything important about the

64

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

complete sequence of positions that led to it. Much of the information about
the sequence is lost, but all that really matters for the future of the game is
retained. Similarly, the current position and velocity of a cannonball is all that
matters for its future ﬂight. It doesn’t matter how that position and velocity
came about. This is sometimes also referred to as an “independence of path”
property because all that matters is in the current state signal; its meaning is
independent of the “path,” or history, of signals that have led up to it.

We now formally deﬁne the Markov property for the reinforcement learning
problem. To keep the mathematics simple, we assume here that there are a
ﬁnite number of states and reward values. This enables us to work in terms
of sums and probabilities rather than integrals and probability densities, but
the argument can easily be extended to include continuous states and rewards.
Consider how a general environment might respond at time t + 1 to the action
taken at time t. In the most general, causal case this response may depend
on everything that has happened earlier. In this case the dynamics can be
deﬁned only by specifying the complete probability distribution:

Rt+1 = r, St+1 = s(cid:48)
Pr
{

|

S0, A0, R1, . . . , St

−

1, At

−

1, Rt, St, At}

,

(3.4)

−

1, Rt, St, At.

for all r, s(cid:48), and all possible values of the past events: S0, A0, R1, ..., St
1,
At
If the state signal has the Markov property, on the other
hand, then the environment’s response at t + 1 depends only on the state and
action representations at t, in which case the environment’s dynamics can be
deﬁned by specifying only

−

p(s(cid:48), r

s, a) = Pr
|

Rt+1 = r, St+1 = s(cid:48)
{

St, At}

,

|

(3.5)

for all r, s(cid:48), St, and At. In other words, a state signal has the Markov property,
and is a Markov state, if and only if (3.5) is equal to (3.4) for all s(cid:48), r, and
1, Rt, St, At. In this case, the environment
1, At
histories, S0, A0, R1, ..., St
and task as a whole are also said to have the Markov property.

−

−

If an environment has the Markov property, then its one-step dynamics
(3.5) enable us to predict the next state and expected next reward given the
current state and action. One can show that, by iterating this equation, one
can predict all future states and expected rewards from knowledge only of the
current state as well as would be possible given the complete history up to the
current time. It also follows that Markov states provide the best possible basis
for choosing actions. That is, the best policy for choosing actions as a function
of a Markov state is just as good as the best policy for choosing actions as a
function of complete histories.

Even when the state signal is non-Markov, it is still appropriate to think
of the state in reinforcement learning as an approximation to a Markov state.

∗3.5. THE MARKOV PROPERTY

In particular, we always want the state to be a good basis for predicting
In cases in which a model of the
future rewards and for selecting actions.
environment is learned (see Chapter 8), we also want the state to be a good
basis for predicting subsequent states. Markov states provide an unsurpassed
basis for doing all of these things. To the extent that the state approaches the
ability of Markov states in these ways, one will obtain better performance from
reinforcement learning systems. For all of these reasons, it is useful to think of
the state at each time step as an approximation to a Markov state, although
one should remember that it may not fully satisfy the Markov property.

The Markov property is important in reinforcement learning because de-
cisions and values are assumed to be a function only of the current state. In
order for these to be eﬀective and informative, the state representation must
be informative. All of the theory presented in this book assumes Markov state
signals. This means that not all the theory strictly applies to cases in which
the Markov property does not strictly apply. However, the theory developed
for the Markov case still helps us to understand the behavior of the algorithms,
and the algorithms can be successfully applied to many tasks with states that
are not strictly Markov. A full understanding of the theory of the Markov
case is an essential foundation for extending it to the more complex and real-
istic non-Markov case. Finally, we note that the assumption of Markov state
representations is not unique to reinforcement learning but is also present in
most if not all other approaches to artiﬁcial intelligence.

Example 3.5: Pole-Balancing State
In the pole-balancing task intro-
duced earlier, a state signal would be Markov if it speciﬁed exactly, or made
it possible to reconstruct exactly, the position and velocity of the cart along
the track, the angle between the cart and the pole, and the rate at which this
angle is changing (the angular velocity). In an idealized cart–pole system, this
information would be suﬃcient to exactly predict the future behavior of the
cart and pole, given the actions taken by the controller. In practice, however,
it is never possible to know this information exactly because any real sensor
would introduce some distortion and delay in its measurements. Furthermore,
in any real cart–pole system there are always other eﬀects, such as the bend-
ing of the pole, the temperatures of the wheel and pole bearings, and various
forms of backlash, that slightly aﬀect the behavior of the system. These factors
would cause violations of the Markov property if the state signal were only the
positions and velocities of the cart and the pole.

However, often the positions and velocities serve quite well as states. Some
early studies of learning to solve the pole-balancing task used a coarse state
signal that divided cart positions into three regions: right, left, and middle
(and similar rough quantizations of the other three intrinsic state variables).
This distinctly non-Markov state was suﬃcient to allow the task to be solved

66

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

easily by reinforcement learning methods. In fact, this coarse representation
may have facilitated rapid learning by forcing the learning agent to ignore ﬁne
distinctions that would not have been useful in solving the task.

Example 3.6: Draw Poker
In draw poker, each player is dealt a hand of
ﬁve cards. There is a round of betting, in which each player exchanges some
of his cards for new ones, and then there is a ﬁnal round of betting. At each
round, each player must match or exceed the highest bets of the other players,
or else drop out (fold). After the second round of betting, the player with the
best hand who has not folded is the winner and collects all the bets.

The state signal in draw poker is diﬀerent for each player. Each player
knows the cards in his own hand, but can only guess at those in the other
players’ hands. A common mistake is to think that a Markov state signal
should include the contents of all the players’ hands and the cards remaining
in the deck. In a fair game, however, we assume that the players are in principle
unable to determine these things from their past observations. If a player did
know them, then she could predict some future events (such as the cards one
could exchange for) better than by remembering all past observations.

In addition to knowledge of one’s own cards, the state in draw poker should
include the bets and the numbers of cards drawn by the other players. For
example, if one of the other players drew three new cards, you may suspect he
retained a pair and adjust your guess of the strength of his hand accordingly.
The players’ bets also inﬂuence your assessment of their hands. In fact, much
of your past history with these particular players is part of the Markov state.
Does Ellen like to bluﬀ, or does she play conservatively? Does her face or
demeanor provide clues to the strength of her hand? How does Joe’s play
change when it is late at night, or when he has already won a lot of money?

Although everything ever observed about the other players may have an
eﬀect on the probabilities that they are holding various kinds of hands, in
practice this is far too much to remember and analyze, and most of it will have
no clear eﬀect on one’s predictions and decisions. Very good poker players are
adept at remembering just the key clues, and at sizing up new players quickly,
but no one remembers everything that is relevant. As a result, the state
representations people use to make their poker decisions are undoubtedly non-
Markov, and the decisions themselves are presumably imperfect. Nevertheless,
people still make very good decisions in such tasks. We conclude that the
inability to have access to a perfect Markov state representation is probably
not a severe problem for a reinforcement learning agent.

3.6 Markov Decision Processes

A reinforcement learning task that satisﬁes the Markov property is called a
Markov decision process, or MDP. If the state and action spaces are ﬁnite,
then it is called a ﬁnite Markov decision process (ﬁnite MDP). Finite MDPs
are particularly important to the theory of reinforcement learning. We treat
them extensively throughout this book; they are all you need to understand
90% of modern reinforcement learning.

A particular ﬁnite MDP is deﬁned by its state and action sets and by the
one-step dynamics of the environment. Given any state and action s and a,
the probability of each possible pair of next state and reward, s(cid:48), r, is denoted

p(s(cid:48), r

s, a) = Pr
|

St+1 = s(cid:48), Rt+1 = r
{

|

St = s, At = a

.
}

(3.6)

These quantities completely specify the dynamics of a ﬁnite MDP. Most of the
theory we present in the rest of this book implicitly assumes the environment
is a ﬁnite MDP.

Given the dynamics as speciﬁed by (3.6), one can compute anything else
one might want to know about the environment, such as the expected rewards
for state–action pairs,

In the ﬁrst edition of this book, the dynamics were expressed exclusively in
terms of the latter two quantities, which were denote Pa
ss(cid:48) respectively.
One weakness of that notation is that it still did not fully characterize the
dynamics of the rewards, giving only their expectations. Another weakness is
the excess of subscripts and superscripts. In this edition we will predominantly
use the explicit notation of (3.6), while sometimes referring directly to the
transition probabilities (3.8).

Example 3.7: Recycling Robot MDP The recycling robot (Example
3.3) can be turned into a simple example of an MDP by simplifying it and

68

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

providing some more details. (Our aim is to produce a simple example, not
a particularly realistic one.) Recall that the agent makes a decision at times
determined by external events (or by other parts of the robot’s control system).
At each such time the robot decides whether it should (1) actively search for
a can, (2) remain stationary and wait for someone to bring it a can, or (3) go
back to home base to recharge its battery. Suppose the environment works
as follows. The best way to ﬁnd cans is to actively search for them, but this
runs down the robot’s battery, whereas waiting does not. Whenever the robot
is searching, the possibility exists that its battery will become depleted. In
this case the robot must shut down and wait to be rescued (producing a low
reward).

The agent makes its decisions solely as a function of the energy level of
the battery. It can distinguish two levels, high and low, so that the state set
is S =
. Let us call the possible decisions—the agent’s actions—
wait, search, and recharge. When the energy level is high, recharging would
always be foolish, so we do not include it in the action set for this state. The
agent’s action sets are

high, low

{

A(high) =
A(low) =

search, wait
}
search, wait, recharge
}

{

.

If the energy level is high, then a period of active search can always be
completed without risk of depleting the battery. A period of searching that
begins with a high energy level leaves the energy level high with probability
α and reduces it to low with probability 1
α. On the other hand, a period of
searching undertaken when the energy level is low leaves it low with probability
β and depletes the battery with probability 1
β. In the latter case, the robot
must be rescued, and the battery is then recharged back to high. Each can
3 results
collected by the robot counts as a unit reward, whereas a reward of
whenever the robot has to be rescued. Let rsearch and rwait, with rsearch > rwait,
respectively denote the expected number of cans the robot will collect (and
hence the expected reward) while searching and while waiting. Finally, to keep
things simple, suppose that no cans can be collected during a run home for
recharging, and that no cans can be collected on a step in which the battery
is depleted. This system is then a ﬁnite MDP, and we can write down the
transition probabilities and the expected rewards, as in Table 3.1.

A transition graph is a useful way to summarize the dynamics of a ﬁnite
MDP. Figure 3.3 shows the transition graph for the recycling robot example.
There are two kinds of nodes: state nodes and action nodes. There is a state
node for each possible state (a large open circle labeled by the name of the
state), and an action node for each state–action pair (a small solid circle labeled

in state s and taking action a moves you along the line from state node s to
action node (s, a). Then the environment responds with a transition to the
next state’s node via one of the arrows leaving action node (s, a). Each arrow
corresponds to a triple (s, s(cid:48), a), where s(cid:48) is the next state, and we label the
arrow with the transition probability, p(s(cid:48)
s, a), and the expected reward for

that transition, r(s, a, s(cid:48)). Note that the transition probabilities labeling the
arrows leaving an action node always sum to 1.

3.7 Value Functions

Almost all reinforcement learning algorithms involve estimating value func-
tions—functions of states (or of state–action pairs) that estimate how good it
is for the agent to be in a given state (or how good it is to perform a given
action in a given state). The notion of “how good” here is deﬁned in terms of
future rewards that can be expected, or, to be precise, in terms of expected
return. Of course the rewards the agent can expect to receive in the future
depend on what actions it will take. Accordingly, value functions are deﬁned
with respect to particular policies.

Recall that a policy, π, is a mapping from each state, s

∈
A(s), to the probability π(a
s) of taking action a when in state s. Informally,
|
the value of a state s under a policy π, denoted vπ(s), is the expected return
when starting in s and following π thereafter. For MDPs, we can deﬁne vπ(s)
formally as

∈

S, and action, a

vπ(s) = Eπ[Gt |

St = s] = Eπ

(cid:88)k=0

,

(cid:35)

(3.10)

where Eπ[
] denotes the expected value of a random variable given that the
·
agent follows policy π, and t is any time step. Note that the value of the
terminal state, if any, is always zero. We call the function vπ the state-value
function for policy π.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Similarly, we deﬁne the value of taking action a in state s under a policy
π, denoted qπ(s, a), as the expected return starting from s, taking the action
a, and thereafter following policy π:

qπ(s, a) = Eπ[Gt |

St = s, At = a] = Eπ
(cid:34)

γkRt+k+1

(cid:88)k=0

We call qπ the action-value function for policy π.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

St = s, At = a

. (3.11)

(cid:35)

The value functions vπ and qπ can be estimated from experience. For ex-
ample, if an agent follows policy π and maintains an average, for each state
encountered, of the actual returns that have followed that state, then the aver-
age will converge to the state’s value, vπ(s), as the number of times that state
is encountered approaches inﬁnity. If separate averages are kept for each ac-
tion taken in a state, then these averages will similarly converge to the action
values, qπ(s, a). We call estimation methods of this kind Monte Carlo methods
because they involve averaging over many random samples of actual returns.
These kinds of methods are presented in Chapter 5. Of course, if there are very
many states, then it may not be practical to keep separate averages for each

3.7. VALUE FUNCTIONS

71

state individually. Instead, the agent would have to maintain vπ and qπ as pa-
rameterized functions and adjust the parameters to better match the observed
returns. This can also produce accurate estimates, although much depends on
the nature of the parameterized function approximator (Chapter 9).

A fundamental property of value functions used throughout reinforcement
learning and dynamic programming is that they satisfy particular recursive
relationships. For any policy π and any state s, the following consistency
condition holds between the value of s and the value of its possible successor
states:

where it is implicit that the actions, a, are taken from the set A(s), the next
states, s(cid:48), are taken from the set S (or from S+ in the case of an episodic
problem), and the rewards, r, are taken from the set R. Note also how in the
last equation we have merged the two sums, one over all the values of s(cid:48) and
the other over all values of r, into one sum over all possible values of both.
We will use this kind of merged sum often to simplify formulas. Note how
the ﬁnal expression can be read very easily as an expected value. It is really
a sum over all values of the three variables, a, s(cid:48), and r. For each triple, we
compute its probability, π(a
s, a), weight the quantity in brackets by
|
that probability, then sum over all possibilities to get an expected value.

s)p(s(cid:48), r
|

Equation (3.12) is the Bellman equation for vπ. It expresses a relationship
between the value of a state and the values of its successor states. Think of
looking ahead from one state to its possible successor states, as suggested by
Figure 3.4a. Each open circle represents a state and each solid circle represents
a state–action pair. Starting from state s, the root node at the top, the agent
could take any of some set of actions—three are shown in Figure 3.4a. From
each of these, the environment could respond with one of several next states,
s(cid:48), along with a reward, r. The Bellman equation (3.12) averages over all the
possibilities, weighting each by its probability of occurring. It states that the

72

Figure 3.4: Backup diagrams for (a) vπ and (b) qπ.

value of the start state must equal the (discounted) value of the expected next
state, plus the reward expected along the way.

The value function vπ is the unique solution to its Bellman equation. We
show in subsequent chapters how this Bellman equation forms the basis of a
number of ways to compute, approximate, and learn vπ. We call diagrams
like those shown in Figure 3.4 backup diagrams because they diagram rela-
tionships that form the basis of the update or backup operations that are at
the heart of reinforcement learning methods. These operations transfer value
information back to a state (or a state–action pair) from its successor states (or
state–action pairs). We use backup diagrams throughout the book to provide
graphical summaries of the algorithms we discuss. (Note that unlike transi-
tion graphs, the state nodes of backup diagrams do not necessarily represent
distinct states; for example, a state might be its own successor. We also omit
explicit arrowheads because time always ﬂows downward in a backup diagram.)

Example 3.8: Gridworld Figure 3.5a uses a rectangular grid to illustrate
value functions for a simple ﬁnite MDP. The cells of the grid correspond to
the states of the environment. At each cell, four actions are possible: north,
south, east, and west, which deterministically cause the agent to move one
cell in the respective direction on the grid. Actions that would take the agent
oﬀ the grid leave its location unchanged, but also result in a reward of
1.
Other actions result in a reward of 0, except those that move the agent out
of the special states A and B. From state A, all four actions yield a reward of
+10 and take the agent to A(cid:48). From state B, all actions yield a reward of +5
and take the agent to B(cid:48).

−

Suppose the agent selects all four actions with equal probability in all
states. Figure 3.5b shows the value function, vπ, for this policy, for the dis-
counted reward case with γ = 0.9. This value function was computed by solv-
ing the system of equations (3.12). Notice the negative values near the lower
edge; these are the result of the high probability of hitting the edge of the grid
there under the random policy. State A is the best state to be in under this pol-

icy, but its expected return is less than 10, its immediate reward, because from
A the agent is taken to A(cid:48), from which it is likely to run into the edge of the
grid. State B, on the other hand, is valued more than 5, its immediate reward,
because from B the agent is taken to B(cid:48), which has a positive value. From B(cid:48) the
expected penalty (negative reward) for possibly running into an edge is more
than compensated for by the expected gain for possibly stumbling onto A or B.

Example 3.9: Golf To formulate playing a hole of golf as a reinforcement
learning task, we count a penalty (negative reward) of
1 for each stroke until
we hit the ball into the hole. The state is the location of the ball. The value of
a state is the negative of the number of strokes to the hole from that location.
Our actions are how we aim and swing at the ball, of course, and which club
we select. Let us take the former as given and consider just the choice of club,
which we assume is either a putter or a driver. The upper part of Figure 3.6
shows a possible state-value function, vputt(s), for the policy that always uses
the putter. The terminal state in-the-hole has a value of 0. From anywhere
on the green we assume we can make a putt; these states have value
1. Oﬀ
the green we cannot reach the hole by putting, and the value is greater. If
we can reach the green from a state by putting, then that state must have
value one less than the green’s value, that is,
2. For simplicity, let us assume
we can putt very precisely and deterministically, but with a limited range.
2 in the ﬁgure; all locations
This gives us the sharp contour line labeled
between that line and the green require exactly two strokes to complete the
hole. Similarly, any location within putting range of the
2 contour line
must have a value of
3, and so on to get all the contour lines shown in the
.
ﬁgure. Putting doesn’t get us out of sand traps, so they have a value of
−∞
Overall, it takes us six strokes to get from the tee to the hole by putting.

3.8 Optimal Value Functions

Solving a reinforcement learning task means, roughly, ﬁnding a policy that
achieves a lot of reward over the long run. For ﬁnite MDPs, we can precisely
deﬁne an optimal policy in the following way. Value functions deﬁne a partial
ordering over policies. A policy π is deﬁned to be better than or equal to a
policy π(cid:48) if its expected return is greater than or equal to that of π(cid:48) for all
S. There
states. In other words, π
π(cid:48) if and only if vπ(s)
is always at least one policy that is better than or equal to all other policies.
This is an optimal policy. Although there may be more than one, we denote
all the optimal policies by π
. They share the same state-value function, called
the optimal state-value function, denoted v
, and deﬁned as

Example 3.10: Optimal Value Functions for Golf The lower part
of Figure 3.6 shows the contours of a possible optimal action-value function
(s, driver). These are the values of each state if we ﬁrst play a stroke with
q
∗
the driver and afterward select either the driver or the putter, whichever is
better. The driver enables us to hit the ball farther, but with less accuracy.
We can reach the hole in one shot using the driver only if we are already very
(s, driver) covers only a small portion of
close; thus the
the green. If we have two strokes, however, then we can reach the hole from
2 contour. In this case we don’t have
much farther away, as shown by the
1 contour, but only to anywhere
to drive all the way to within the small
on the green; from there we can use the putter. The optimal action-value
function gives the values after committing to a particular ﬁrst action, in this
case, to the driver, but afterward using whichever actions are best. The
3

contour is still farther out and includes the starting tee. From the tee, the best
sequence of actions is two drives and one putt, sinking the ball in three strokes.

Because v

is the value function for a policy,

it must satisfy the self-
consistency condition given by the Bellman equation for state values (3.12).
Because it is the optimal value function, however, v
’s consistency condition
∗
can be written in a special form without reference to any speciﬁc policy. This
is the Bellman equation for v
, or the Bellman optimality equation. Intuitively,
∗
the Bellman optimality equation expresses the fact that the value of a state
under an optimal policy must equal the expected return for the best action
from that state:

The backup diagrams in Figure 3.7 show graphically the spans of future
states and actions considered in the Bellman optimality equations for v
and
q
. These are the same as the backup diagrams for vπ and qπ except that arcs
∗
have been added at the agent’s choice points to represent that the maximum
over that choice is taken rather than the expected value given some policy.
Figure 3.7a graphically represents the Bellman optimality equation (3.17).

∗

For ﬁnite MDPs, the Bellman optimality equation (3.17) has a unique so-
lution independent of the policy. The Bellman optimality equation is actually
a system of equations, one for each state, so if there are N states, then there
are N equations in N unknowns.
If the dynamics of the environment are
s, a)), then in principle one can solve this system of equations
known (p(s(cid:48), r

Once one has v
∗

If you have the optimal value function, v

, it is relatively easy to determine an optimal policy. For
each state s, there will be one or more actions at which the maximum is ob-
tained in the Bellman optimality equation. Any policy that assigns nonzero
probability only to these actions is an optimal policy. You can think of this
as a one-step search.
, then the
actions that appear best after a one-step search will be optimal actions. An-
other way of saying this is that any policy that is greedy with respect to
the optimal evaluation function v
is an optimal policy. The term greedy is
∗
used in computer science to describe any search or decision procedure that
selects alternatives based only on local or immediate considerations, without
considering the possibility that such a selection may prevent future access to
even better alternatives. Consequently, it describes policies that select actions
based only on their short-term consequences. The beauty of v
is that if one
uses it to evaluate the short-term consequences of actions—speciﬁcally, the
one-step consequences—then a greedy policy is actually optimal in the long-
term sense in which we are interested because v
already takes into account
∗
the reward consequences of all possible future behavior. By means of v
, the
∗
optimal expected long-term return is turned into a quantity that is locally and
immediately available for each state. Hence, a one-step-ahead search yields
the long-term optimal actions.

∗

∗

Having q

makes choosing optimal actions still easier. With q
, the agent
does not even have to do a one-step-ahead search: for any state s, it can simply
(s, a). The action-value function eﬀectively
ﬁnd any action that maximizes q
caches the results of all one-step-ahead searches. It provides the optimal ex-
pected long-term return as a value that is locally and immediately available
for each state–action pair. Hence, at the cost of representing a function of
state–action pairs, instead of just of states, the optimal action-value function
allows optimal actions to be selected without having to know anything about
possible successor states and their values, that is, without having to know

Example 3.12: Solving the Gridworld Suppose we solve the Bellman
equation for v
for the simple grid task introduced in Example 3.8 and shown
∗
again in Figure 3.8a. Recall that state A is followed by a reward of +10 and
transition to state A(cid:48), while state B is followed by a reward of +5 and transition
to state B(cid:48). Figure 3.8b shows the optimal value function, and Figure 3.8c
shows the corresponding optimal policies. Where there are multiple arrows in
a cell, any of the corresponding actions is optimal.

Explicitly solving the Bellman optimality equation provides one route to
ﬁnding an optimal policy, and thus to solving the reinforcement learning prob-
lem. However, this solution is rarely directly useful. It is akin to an exhaustive
search, looking ahead at all possibilities, computing their probabilities of oc-
currence and their desirabilities in terms of expected rewards. This solution
relies on at least three assumptions that are rarely true in practice: (1) we
accurately know the dynamics of the environment; (2) we have enough com-
putational resources to complete the computation of the solution; and (3) the
Markov property. For the kinds of tasks in which we are interested, one is

3.9. OPTIMALITY AND APPROXIMATION

generally not able to implement this solution exactly because various com-
binations of these assumptions are violated. For example, although the ﬁrst
and third assumptions present no problems for the game of backgammon, the
second is a major impediment. Since the game has about 1020 states, it would
take thousands of years on today’s fastest computers to solve the Bellman
equation for v
. In reinforcement learning
∗
one typically has to settle for approximate solutions.

, and the same is true for ﬁnding q

∗

Many diﬀerent decision-making methods can be viewed as ways of ap-
proximately solving the Bellman optimality equation. For example, heuristic
search methods can be viewed as expanding the right-hand side of (3.17) sev-
eral times, up to some depth, forming a “tree” of possibilities, and then using
a heuristic evaluation function to approximate v
at the “leaf” nodes. (Heuris-
∗
tic search methods such as A∗ are almost always based on the episodic case.)
The methods of dynamic programming can be related even more closely to
the Bellman optimality equation. Many reinforcement learning methods can
be clearly understood as approximately solving the Bellman optimality equa-
tion, using actual experienced transitions in place of knowledge of the expected
transitions. We consider a variety of such methods in the following chapters.

3.9 Optimality and Approximation

We have deﬁned optimal value functions and optimal policies. Clearly, an
agent that learns an optimal policy has done very well, but in practice this
rarely happens. For the kinds of tasks in which we are interested, optimal
policies can be generated only with extreme computational cost. A well-deﬁned
notion of optimality organizes the approach to learning we describe in this book
and provides a way to understand the theoretical properties of various learning
algorithms, but it is an ideal that agents can only approximate to varying
degrees. As we discussed above, even if we have a complete and accurate
model of the environment’s dynamics, it is usually not possible to simply

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

compute an optimal policy by solving the Bellman optimality equation. For
example, board games such as chess are a tiny fraction of human experience,
yet large, custom-designed computers still cannot compute the optimal moves.
A critical aspect of the problem facing the agent is always the computational
power available to it, in particular, the amount of computation it can perform
in a single time step.

The memory available is also an important constraint. A large amount
of memory is often required to build up approximations of value functions,
In tasks with small, ﬁnite state sets, it is possible to
policies, and models.
form these approximations using arrays or tables with one entry for each state
(or state–action pair). This we call the tabular case, and the corresponding
methods we call tabular methods. In many cases of practical interest, however,
there are far more states than could possibly be entries in a table. In these
cases the functions must be approximated, using some sort of more compact
parameterized function representation.

Our framing of the reinforcement learning problem forces us to settle for
approximations. However, it also presents us with some unique opportunities
for achieving useful approximations.
For example, in approximating opti-
mal behavior, there may be many states that the agent faces with such a low
probability that selecting suboptimal actions for them has little impact on the
amount of reward the agent receives. Tesauro’s backgammon player, for exam-
ple, plays with exceptional skill even though it might make very bad decisions
on board conﬁgurations that never occur in games against experts. In fact, it
is possible that TD-Gammon makes bad decisions for a large fraction of the
game’s state set. The on-line nature of reinforcement learning makes it possi-
ble to approximate optimal policies in ways that put more eﬀort into learning
to make good decisions for frequently encountered states, at the expense of
less eﬀort for infrequently encountered states. This is one key property that
distinguishes reinforcement learning from other approaches to approximately
solving MDPs.

3.10 Summary

Let us summarize the elements of the reinforcement learning problem that
we have presented in this chapter. Reinforcement learning is about learning
from interaction how to behave in order to achieve a goal. The reinforcement
learning agent and its environment interact over a sequence of discrete time
steps. The speciﬁcation of their interface deﬁnes a particular task: the actions
are the choices made by the agent; the states are the basis for making the
choices; and the rewards are the basis for evaluating the choices. Everything

3.10. SUMMARY

81

inside the agent is completely known and controllable by the agent; everything
outside is incompletely controllable but may or may not be completely known.
A policy is a stochastic rule by which the agent selects actions as a function of
states. The agent’s objective is to maximize the amount of reward it receives
over time.

The return is the function of future rewards that the agent seeks to max-
imize. It has several diﬀerent deﬁnitions depending upon the nature of the
task and whether one wishes to discount delayed reward. The undiscounted
formulation is appropriate for episodic tasks, in which the agent–environment
interaction breaks naturally into episodes; the discounted formulation is appro-
priate for continuing tasks, in which the interaction does not naturally break
into episodes but continues without limit.

An environment satisﬁes the Markov property if its state signal compactly
summarizes the past without degrading the ability to predict the future. This
is rarely exactly true, but often nearly so; the state signal should be chosen or
constructed so that the Markov property holds as nearly as possible. In this
book we assume that this has already been done and focus on the decision-
making problem: how to decide what to do as a function of whatever state
signal is available. If the Markov property does hold, then the environment is
called a Markov decision process (MDP). A ﬁnite MDP is an MDP with ﬁnite
state and action sets. Most of the current theory of reinforcement learning is
restricted to ﬁnite MDPs, but the methods and ideas apply more generally.

A policy’s value functions assign to each state, or state–action pair, the
expected return from that state, or state–action pair, given that the agent uses
the policy. The optimal value functions assign to each state, or state–action
pair, the largest expected return achievable by any policy. A policy whose value
functions are optimal is an optimal policy. Whereas the optimal value functions
for states and state–action pairs are unique for a given MDP, there can be many
optimal policies. Any policy that is greedy with respect to the optimal value
functions must be an optimal policy. The Bellman optimality equations are
special consistency condition that the optimal value functions must satisfy and
that can, in principle, be solved for the optimal value functions, from which
an optimal policy can be determined with relative ease.

A reinforcement learning problem can be posed in a variety of diﬀerent ways
depending on assumptions about the level of knowledge initially available to
the agent. In problems of complete knowledge, the agent has a complete and
accurate model of the environment’s dynamics. If the environment is an MDP,
then such a model consists of the one-step transition probabilities and expected
rewards for all states and their allowable actions. In problems of incomplete
knowledge, a complete and perfect model of the environment is not available.

82

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

Even if the agent has a complete and accurate environment model, the
agent is typically unable to perform enough computation per time step to fully
use it. The memory available is also an important constraint. Memory may
be required to build up accurate approximations of value functions, policies,
and models. In most cases of practical interest there are far more states than
could possibly be entries in a table, and approximations must be made.

A well-deﬁned notion of optimality organizes the approach to learning we
describe in this book and provides a way to understand the theoretical prop-
erties of various learning algorithms, but it is an ideal that reinforcement
learning agents can only approximate to varying degrees.
In reinforcement
learning we are very much concerned with cases in which optimal solutions
cannot be found but must be approximated in some way.

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

The reinforcement learning problem is deeply indebted to the idea of Markov
decision processes (MDPs) from the ﬁeld of optimal control. These histor-
ical inﬂuences and other major inﬂuences from psychology are described in
the brief history given in Chapter 1. Reinforcement learning adds to MDPs a
focus on approximation and incomplete information for realistically large prob-
lems. MDPs and the reinforcement learning problem are only weakly linked
to traditional learning and decision-making problems in artiﬁcial intelligence.
However, artiﬁcial intelligence is now vigorously exploring MDP formulations
for planning and decision-making from a variety of perspectives. MDPs are
more general than previous formulations used in artiﬁcial intelligence in that
they permit more general kinds of goals and uncertainty.

Our presentation of the reinforcement learning problem was inﬂuenced by

Watkins (1989).

3.1

The bioreactor example is based on the work of Ungar (1990) and Miller
and Williams (1992). The recycling robot example was inspired by the
can-collecting robot built by Jonathan Connell (1989).

3.3–4 The terminology of episodic and continuing tasks is diﬀerent from that
usually used in the MDP literature.
In that literature it is common
to distinguish three types of tasks: (1) ﬁnite-horizon tasks, in which
interaction terminates after a particular ﬁxed number of time steps; (2)
indeﬁnite-horizon tasks, in which interaction can last arbitrarily long
but must eventually terminate; and (3) inﬁnite-horizon tasks, in which
interaction does not terminate. Our episodic and continuing tasks are

3.10. SUMMARY

83

similar to indeﬁnite-horizon and inﬁnite-horizon tasks, respectively, but
we prefer to emphasize the diﬀerence in the nature of the interaction.
This diﬀerence seems more fundamental than the diﬀerence in the ob-
jective functions emphasized by the usual terms. Often episodic tasks
use an indeﬁnite-horizon objective function and continuing tasks an
inﬁnite-horizon objective function, but we see this as a common coin-
cidence rather than a fundamental diﬀerence.

The pole-balancing example is from Michie and Chambers (1968) and
Barto, Sutton, and Anderson (1983).

3.5

For further discussion of the concept of state, see Minsky (1967).

3.6

The theory of MDPs is treated by, e.g., Bertsekas (1995), Ross (1983),
White (1969), and Whittle (1982, 1983). This theory is also studied
under the heading of stochastic optimal control, where adaptive optimal
control methods are most closely related to reinforcement learning (e.g.,
Kumar, 1985; Kumar and Varaiya, 1986).

The theory of MDPs evolved from eﬀorts to understand the problem
of making sequences of decisions under uncertainty, where each deci-
sion can depend on the previous decisions and their outcomes.
It is
sometimes called the theory of multistage decision processes, or se-
quential decision processes, and has roots in the statistical literature
on sequential sampling beginning with the papers by Thompson (1933,
1934) and Robbins (1952) that we cited in Chapter 2 in connection
with bandit problems (which are prototypical MDPs if formulated as
multiple-situation problems).

The earliest instance of which we are aware in which reinforcement
learning was discussed using the MDP formalism is Andreae’s (1969b)
description of a uniﬁed view of learning machines. Witten and Corbin
(1973) experimented with a reinforcement learning system later ana-
lyzed by Witten (1977) using the MDP formalism. Although he did not
explicitly mention MDPs, Werbos (1977) suggested approximate solu-
tion methods for stochastic optimal control problems that are related to
modern reinforcement learning methods (see also Werbos, 1982, 1987,
1988, 1989, 1992). Although Werbos’s ideas were not widely recognized
at the time, they were prescient in emphasizing the importance of ap-
proximately solving optimal control problems in a variety of domains,
including artiﬁcial intelligence. The most inﬂuential integration of rein-
forcement learning and MDPs is due to Watkins (1989). His treatment
of reinforcement learning using the MDP formalism has been widely
adopted.

84

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

Our characterization of the dynamics of an MDP in terms of p(s(cid:48), r
s, a)
|
is slightly unusual. It is more common in the MDP literature to describe
the dynamics in terms of the state transition probabilities p(s(cid:48)
s, a) and
|
expected next rewards r(s, a). In reinforcement learning, however, we
more often have to refer to individual actual or sample rewards (rather
than just their expected values). Our notation also makes it plainer that
St and Rt are in general jointly determined, and thus must have the
same time index. In teaching reinforcement learning, we have found
our notation to be more straightforward conceptually and easier to
understand.

3.7–8 Assigning value on the basis of what is good or bad in the long run has
ancient roots.
In control theory, mapping states to numerical values
representing the long-term consequences of control decisions is a key
part of optimal control theory, which was developed in the 1950s by ex-
tending nineteenth century state-function theories of classical mechan-
ics (see, e.g., Schultz and Melsa, 1967). In describing how a computer
could be programmed to play chess, Shannon (1950) suggested using
an evaluation function that took into account the long-term advantages
and disadvantages of chess positions.

∗

Watkins’s (1989) Q-learning algorithm for estimating q
(Chapter 6)
made action-value functions an important part of reinforcement learn-
ing, and consequently these functions are often called Q-functions. But
the idea of an action-value function is much older than this. Shannon
(1950) suggested that a function h(P, M ) could be used by a chess-
playing program to decide whether a move M in position P is worth
exploring. Michie’s (1961, 1963) MENACE system and Michie and
Chambers’s (1968) BOXES system can be understood as estimating
action-value functions. In classical physics, Hamilton’s principal func-
tion is an action-value function; Newtonian dynamics are greedy with
respect to this function (e.g., Goldstein, 1957). Action-value functions
also played a central role in Denardo’s (1967) theoretical treatment of
DP in terms of contraction mappings.

What we call the Bellman equation for v
was ﬁrst introduced by
∗
Richard Bellman (1957a), who called it the “basic functional equa-
tion.” The counterpart of the Bellman optimality equation for continu-
ous time and state problems is known as the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman
equation (or often just the Hamilton–Jacobi equation), indicating its
roots in classical physics (e.g., Schultz and Melsa, 1967).

The golf example was suggested by Chris Watkins.

3.10. SUMMARY

Exercises

85

Exercise 3.1 Devise three example tasks of your own that ﬁt into the re-
inforcement learning framework, identifying for each its states, actions, and
rewards. Make the three examples as diﬀerent from each other as possible.
The framework is abstract and ﬂexible and can be applied in many diﬀerent
ways. Stretch its limits in some way in at least one of your examples.

Exercise 3.2 Is the reinforcement learning framework adequate to usefully
represent all goal-directed learning tasks? Can you think of any clear excep-
tions?

Exercise 3.3 Consider the problem of driving. You could deﬁne the actions
in terms of the accelerator, steering wheel, and brake, that is, where your
body meets the machine. Or you could deﬁne them farther out—say, where
the rubber meets the road, considering your actions to be tire torques. Or
you could deﬁne them farther in—say, where your brain meets your body, the
actions being muscle twitches to control your limbs. Or you could go to a
really high level and say that your actions are your choices of where to drive.
What is the right level, the right place to draw the line between agent and
environment? On what basis is one location of the line to be preferred over
another? Is there any fundamental reason for preferring one location over
another, or is it a free choice?

Exercise 3.4 Suppose you treated pole-balancing as an episodic task but
also used discounting, with all rewards zero except for
1 upon failure. What
then would the return be at each time? How does this return diﬀer from that
in the discounted, continuing formulation of this task?

−

Exercise 3.5 Imagine that you are designing a robot to run a maze. You de-
cide to give it a reward of +1 for escaping from the maze and a reward of zero
at all other times. The task seems to break down naturally into episodes—the
successive runs through the maze—so you decide to treat it as an episodic task,
where the goal is to maximize expected total reward (3.1). After running the
learning agent for a while, you ﬁnd that it is showing no improvement in escap-
ing from the maze. What is going wrong? Have you eﬀectively communicated
to the agent what you want it to achieve?

Exercise 3.6: Broken Vision System Imagine that you are a vision
system. When you are ﬁrst turned on for the day, an image ﬂoods into your
camera. You can see lots of things, but not all things. You can’t see objects
that are occluded, and of course you can’t see objects that are behind you.
After seeing that ﬁrst scene, do you have access to the Markov state of the
environment? Suppose your camera was broken that day and you received no

86

CHAPTER 3. FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES

images at all, all day. Would you have access to the Markov state then?

Exercise 3.7 There is no exercise 3.7.

Exercise 3.8 What is the Bellman equation for action values, that is, for qπ?
It must give the action value qπ(s, a) in terms of the action values, qπ(s(cid:48), a(cid:48)),
of possible successors to the state–action pair (s, a). As a hint, the backup
diagram corresponding to this equation is given in Figure 3.4b. Show the
sequence of equations analogous to (3.12), but for action values.

Exercise 3.9 The Bellman equation (3.12) must hold for each state for the
value function vπ shown in Figure 3.5b. As an example, show numerically that
this equation holds for the center state, valued at +0.7, with respect to its four
0.4, and +0.7. (These numbers are
neighboring states, valued at +2.3, +0.4,
accurate only to one decimal place.)

−

Exercise 3.10 In the gridworld example, rewards are positive for goals,
negative for running into the edge of the world, and zero the rest of the time.
Are the signs of these rewards important, or only the intervals between them?
Prove, using (3.2), that adding a constant c to all the rewards adds a constant,
vc, to the values of all states, and thus does not aﬀect the relative values of
any states under any policies. What is vc in terms of c and γ?

Exercise 3.11 Now consider adding a constant c to all the rewards in an
episodic task, such as maze running. Would this have any eﬀect, or would it
leave the task unchanged as in the continuing task above? Why or why not?
Give an example.

Exercise 3.12 The value of a state depends on the the values of the actions
possible in that state and on how likely each action is to be taken under the
current policy. We can think of this in terms of a small backup diagram rooted
at the state and considering each possible action:

Give the equation corresponding to this intuition and diagram for the value at
the root node, vπ(s), in terms of the value at the expected leaf node, qπ(s, a),
given St = s. This expectation depends on the policy, π. Then give a second
equation in which the expected value is written out explicitly in terms of π(a
s)
|
such that no expected value notation appears in the equation.

Dynamic Programming

The term dynamic programming (DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that
can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the envi-
ronment as a Markov decision process (MDP). Classical DP algorithms are of
limited utility in reinforcement learning both because of their assumption of
a perfect model and because of their great computational expense, but they
are still important theoretically. DP provides an essential foundation for the
understanding of the methods presented in the rest of this book. In fact, all
of these methods can be viewed as attempts to achieve much the same eﬀect
as DP, only with less computation and without assuming a perfect model of
the environment.

Starting with this chapter, we usually assume that the environment is a
ﬁnite MDP. That is, we assume that its state, action, and reward sets, S,
S, are ﬁnite, and that its dynamics are given by a set of
A(s), and R, for s

plus a terminal state if the problem is episodic). Although DP ideas can be
applied to problems with continuous state and action spaces, exact solutions
are possible only in special cases. A common way of obtaining approximate
solutions for tasks with continuous states and actions is to quantize the state
and action spaces and then apply ﬁnite-state DP methods. The methods we
explore in Chapter 9 are applicable to continuous problems and are a signiﬁcant
extension of that approach.

The key idea of DP, and of reinforcement learning generally, is the use of
value functions to organize and structure the search for good policies. In this
chapter we show how DP can be used to compute the value functions deﬁned
in Chapter 3. As discussed there, we can easily obtain optimal policies once
we have found the optimal value functions, v

4.1 Policy Evaluation

First we consider how to compute the state-value function vπ for an arbitrary
policy π. This is called policy evaluation in the DP literature. We also refer
to it as the prediction problem. Recall from Chapter 3 that, for all s

purposes, iterative solution methods are most suitable. Consider a sequence of

approximation, v0, is chosen arbitrarily (except that the terminal state, if any,

can be shown in general to converge to vπ as k

sequence
under the
same conditions that guarantee the existence of vπ. This algorithm is called
iterative policy evaluation.

→ ∞

{

To produce each successive approximation, vk+1 from vk, iterative policy
evaluation applies the same operation to each state s: it replaces the old value
of s with a new value obtained from the old values of the successor states
of s, and the expected immediate rewards, along all the one-step transitions
possible under the policy being evaluated. We call this kind of operation a
full backup. Each iteration of iterative policy evaluation backs up the value of
every state once to produce the new approximate value function vk+1. There
are several diﬀerent kinds of full backups, depending on whether a state (as
here) or a state–action pair is being backed up, and depending on the precise
way the estimated values of the successor states are combined. All the backups
done in DP algorithms are called full backups because they are based on all
possible next states rather than on a sample next state. The nature of a
backup can be expressed in an equation, as above, or in a backup diagram
like those introduced in Chapter 3. For example, Figure 3.4a is the backup
diagram corresponding to the full backup used in iterative policy evaluation.

To write a sequential computer program to implement iterative policy eval-
uation, as given by (4.5), you would have to use two arrays, one for the old
values, vk(s), and one for the new values, vk+1(s). This way, the new values
can be computed one by one from the old values without the old values being
changed. Of course it is easier to use one array and update the values “in
place,” that is, with each new backed-up value immediately overwriting the
old one. Then, depending on the order in which the states are backed up,
sometimes new values are used instead of old ones on the right-hand side of
(4.5). This slightly diﬀerent algorithm also converges to vπ; in fact, it usually
converges faster than the two-array version, as you might expect, since it uses
new data as soon as they are available. We think of the backups as being done
in a sweep through the state space. For the in-place algorithm, the order in
which states are backed up during the sweep has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
rate of convergence. We usually have the in-place version in mind when we
think of DP algorithms.

Another implementation point concerns the termination of the algorithm.
Formally, iterative policy evaluation converges only in the limit, but in practice
it must be halted short of this. A typical stopping condition for iterative policy
evaluation is to test the quantity maxs
after each sweep and
S

4.2 Policy Improvement

Our reason for computing the value function for a policy is to help ﬁnd better
policies. Suppose we have determined the value function vπ for an arbitrary
deterministic policy π. For some state s we would like to know whether or not
= π(s).
we should change the policy to deterministically choose an action a
We know how good it is to follow the current policy from s—that is vπ(s)—but
would it be better or worse to change to the new policy? One way to answer
this question is to consider selecting a in s and thereafter following the existing
policy, π. The value of this way of behaving is

qπ(s, a) = Eπ[Rt+1 + γvπ(St+1)

St = s, At = a]

=

p(s(cid:48), r

(cid:88)s(cid:48),r

s, a)
|

(cid:104)

|
r + γvπ(s(cid:48))
(cid:105)

.

(4.6)

The key criterion is whether this is greater than or less than vπ(s). If it is
greater—that is, if it is better to select a once in s and thereafter follow π
than it would be to follow π all the time—then one would expect it to be
better still to select a every time s is encountered, and that the new policy
would in fact be a better one overall.

That this is true is a special case of a general result called the policy
improvement theorem. Let π and π(cid:48) be any pair of deterministic policies such
that, for all s

S,

∈
qπ(s, π(cid:48)(s))

vπ(s).

≥

(4.7)

Then the policy π(cid:48) must be as good as, or better than, π. That is, it must
obtain greater or equal expected return from all states s

S:

∈

vπ(cid:48)(s)

≥

vπ(s).

(4.8)

Moreover, if there is strict inequality of (4.7) at any state, then there must be
strict inequality of (4.8) at at least one state. This result applies in particular
to the two policies that we considered in the previous paragraph, an original
deterministic policy, π, and a changed policy, π(cid:48), that is identical to π except
that π(cid:48)(s) = a
= π(s). Obviously, (4.7) holds at all states other than s. Thus,
if qπ(s, a) > vπ(s), then the changed policy is indeed better than π.

The idea behind the proof of the policy improvement theorem is easy to
understand. Starting from (4.7), we keep expanding the qπ side and reapplying

So far we have seen how, given a policy and its value function, we can easily
evaluate a change in the policy at a single state to a particular action. It is a
natural extension to consider changes at all states and to all possible actions,
selecting at each state the action that appears best according to qπ(s, a). In
other words, to consider the new greedy policy, π(cid:48), given by

(cid:105)

where argmaxa denotes the value of a at which the expression that follows is
maximized (with ties broken arbitrarily). The greedy policy takes the action
that looks best in the short term—after one step of lookahead—according to
vπ. By construction, the greedy policy meets the conditions of the policy
improvement theorem (4.7), so we know that it is as good as, or better than,
the original policy. The process of making a new policy that improves on an
original policy, by making it greedy with respect to the value function of the
original policy, is called policy improvement.

Suppose the new greedy policy, π(cid:48), is as good as, but not better than, the

old policy π. Then vπ = vπ(cid:48), and from (4.9) it follows that for all s

But this is the same as the Bellman optimality equation (4.1), and therefore,
, and both π and π(cid:48) must be optimal policies. Policy improve-
vπ(cid:48) must be v
∗
ment thus must give us a strictly better policy except when the original policy
is already optimal.

So far in this section we have considered the special case of deterministic
policies. In the general case, a stochastic policy π speciﬁes probabilities, π(a
s),
|
for taking each action, a, in each state, s. We will not go through the details,
but in fact all the ideas of this section extend easily to stochastic policies. In
particular, the policy improvement theorem carries through as stated for the
stochastic case, under the natural deﬁnition:

qπ(s, π(cid:48)(s)) =

π(cid:48)(a

s)qπ(s, a).
|

a
(cid:88)

In addition, if there are ties in policy improvement steps such as (4.9)—that
is, if there are several actions at which the maximum is achieved—then in the
stochastic case we need not select a single action from among them. Instead,
each maximizing action can be given a portion of the probability of being
selected in the new greedy policy. Any apportioning scheme is allowed as long
as all submaximal actions are given zero probability.

The last row of Figure 4.2 shows an example of policy improvement for
stochastic policies. Here the original policy, π, is the equiprobable random
policy, and the new policy, π(cid:48), is greedy with respect to vπ. The value function
vπ is shown in the bottom-left diagram and the set of possible π(cid:48) is shown in
the bottom-right diagram. The states with multiple arrows in the π(cid:48) diagram
are those in which several actions achieve the maximum in (4.9); any appor-
tionment of probability among these actions is permitted. The value function
of any such policy, vπ(cid:48)(s), can be seen by inspection to be either

4.3 Policy Iteration

Once a policy, π, has been improved using vπ to yield a better policy, π(cid:48), we can
then compute vπ(cid:48) and improve it again to yield an even better π(cid:48)(cid:48). We can thus

(unless it is already optimal). Because a ﬁnite MDP has only a ﬁnite number
of policies, this process must converge to an optimal policy and optimal value
function in a ﬁnite number of iterations.

This way of ﬁnding an optimal policy is called policy iteration. A complete
algorithm is given in Figure 4.3. Note that each policy evaluation, itself an
iterative computation, is started with the value function for the previous policy.
This typically results in a great increase in the speed of convergence of policy
evaluation (presumably because the value function changes little from one
policy to the next).

Policy iteration often converges in surprisingly few iterations. This is illus-
trated by the example in Figure 4.2. The bottom-left diagram shows the value
function for the equiprobable random policy, and the bottom-right diagram
shows a greedy policy for this value function. The policy improvement theo-
rem assures us that these policies are better than the original random policy.
In this case, however, these policies are not just better, but optimal, proceed-

ing to the terminal states in the minimum number of steps. In this example,
policy iteration would ﬁnd the optimal policy after just one iteration.

Example 4.2: Jack’s Car Rental
Jack manages two locations for a na-
tionwide car rental company. Each day, some number of customers arrive at
each location to rent cars. If Jack has a car available, he rents it out and is
credited $10 by the national company. If he is out of cars at that location,
then the business is lost. Cars become available for renting the day after they
are returned. To help ensure that cars are available where they are needed,
Jack can move them between the two locations overnight, at a cost of $2 per
car moved. We assume that the number of cars requested and returned at
each location are Poisson random variables, meaning that the probability that
the number is n is λn
λ, where λ is the expected number. Suppose λ is 3
and 4 for rental requests at the ﬁrst and second locations and 3 and 2 for
returns. To simplify the problem slightly, we assume that there can be no
more than 20 cars at each location (any additional cars are returned to the
nationwide company, and thus disappear from the problem) and a maximum
of ﬁve cars can be moved from one location to the other in one night. We take
the discount rate to be γ = 0.9 and formulate this as a continuing ﬁnite MDP,
where the time steps are days, the state is the number of cars at each location
at the end of the day, and the actions are the net numbers of cars moved
between the two locations overnight. Figure 4.4 shows the sequence of policies
found by policy iteration starting from the policy that never moves any cars.

4.4 Value Iteration

One drawback to policy iteration is that each of its iterations involves policy
evaluation, which may itself be a protracted iterative computation requiring
multiple sweeps through the state set. If policy evaluation is done iteratively,
then convergence exactly to vπ occurs only in the limit. Must we wait for
exact convergence, or can we stop short of that? The example in Figure 4.2
certainly suggests that it may be possible to truncate policy evaluation. In
that example, policy evaluation iterations beyond the ﬁrst three have no eﬀect
on the corresponding greedy policy.

In fact, the policy evaluation step of policy iteration can be truncated in
several ways without losing the convergence guarantees of policy iteration.
One important special case is when policy evaluation is stopped after just one
sweep (one backup of each state). This algorithm is called value iteration. It
can be written as a particularly simple backup operation that combines the

for each number of cars at each location at the end of the day, the number
of cars to be moved from the ﬁrst location to the second (negative numbers
indicate transfers from the second location to the ﬁrst). Each successive policy

∗

Another way of understanding value iteration is by reference to the Bellman
optimality equation (4.1). Note that value iteration is obtained simply by
turning the Bellman optimality equation into an update rule. Also note how
the value iteration backup is identical to the policy evaluation backup (4.5)
except that it requires the maximum to be taken over all actions. Another
way of seeing this close relationship is to compare the backup diagrams for
these algorithms: Figure 3.4a shows the backup diagram for policy evaluation
and Figure 3.7a shows the backup diagram for value iteration. These two are
the natural backup operations for computing vπ and v
∗

.

Finally, let us consider how value iteration terminates. Like policy eval-
uation, value iteration formally requires an inﬁnite number of iterations to
converge exactly to v
. In practice, we stop once the value function changes
∗
by only a small amount in a sweep. Figure 4.5 gives a complete value iteration
algorithm with this kind of termination condition.

Value iteration eﬀectively combines, in each of its sweeps, one sweep of
policy evaluation and one sweep of policy improvement. Faster convergence is
often achieved by interposing multiple policy evaluation sweeps between each
policy improvement sweep.
In general, the entire class of truncated policy
iteration algorithms can be thought of as sequences of sweeps, some of which
use policy evaluation backups and some of which use value iteration backups.
Since the max operation in (4.10) is the only diﬀerence between these backups,
this just means that the max operation is added to some sweeps of policy
evaluation. All of these algorithms converge to an optimal policy for discounted
ﬁnite MDPs.

Example 4.3: Gambler’s Problem A gambler has the opportunity to
make bets on the outcomes of a sequence of coin ﬂips. If the coin comes up
heads, he wins as many dollars as he has staked on that ﬂip; if it is tails, he
loses his stake. The game ends when the gambler wins by reaching his goal
of $100, or loses by running out of money. On each ﬂip, the gambler must
decide what portion of his capital to stake, in integer numbers of dollars. This
problem can be formulated as an undiscounted, episodic, ﬁnite MDP. The
state is the gambler’s capital, s
and the actions are stakes,

those on which the gambler reaches his goal, when it is +1. The state-value
function then gives the probability of winning from each state. A policy is a
mapping from levels of capital to stakes. The optimal policy maximizes the
probability of reaching the goal. Let ph denote the probability of the coin
coming up heads. If ph is known, then the entire problem is known and it can
be solved, for instance, by value iteration. Figure 4.6 shows the change in the
value function over successive sweeps of value iteration, and the ﬁnal policy
found, for the case of ph = 0.4. This policy is optimal, but not unique. In
fact, there is a whole family of optimal policies, all corresponding to ties for
the argmax action selection with respect to the optimal value function. Can
you guess what the entire family looks like?

4.5 Asynchronous Dynamic Programming

A major drawback to the DP methods that we have discussed so far is that
they involve operations over the entire state set of the MDP, that is, they
require sweeps of the state set. If the state set is very large, then even a single
sweep can be prohibitively expensive. For example, the game of backgammon
has over 1020 states. Even if we could perform the value iteration backup on
a million states per second, it would take over a thousand years to complete a
single sweep.

Asynchronous DP algorithms are in-place iterative DP algorithms that are
not organized in terms of systematic sweeps of the state set. These algorithms
back up the values of states in any order whatsoever, using whatever values of

other states happen to be available. The values of some states may be backed
up several times before the values of others are backed up once. To converge
correctly, however, an asynchronous algorithm must continue to backup the
values of all the states:
it can’t ignore any state after some point in the
computation. Asynchronous DP algorithms allow great ﬂexibility in selecting
states to which backup operations are applied.

For example, one version of asynchronous value iteration backs up the
value, in place, of only one state, sk, on each step, k, using the value iteration

only that all states occur in the sequence
an inﬁnite number of times
(the sequence could even be stochastic). (In the undiscounted episodic case,
it is possible that there are some orderings of backups that do not result in
convergence, but it is relatively easy to avoid these.) Similarly, it is possible
to intermix policy evaluation and value iteration backups to produce a kind
of asynchronous truncated policy iteration. Although the details of this and
other more unusual DP algorithms are beyond the scope of this book, it is clear
that a few diﬀerent backups form building blocks that can be used ﬂexibly in
a wide variety of sweepless DP algorithms.

sk}
{

Of course, avoiding sweeps does not necessarily mean that we can get away
with less computation. It just means that an algorithm does not need to get
locked into any hopelessly long sweep before it can make progress improving a
policy. We can try to take advantage of this ﬂexibility by selecting the states
to which we apply backups so as to improve the algorithm’s rate of progress.
We can try to order the backups to let value information propagate from state
to state in an eﬃcient way. Some states may not need their values backed up
as often as others. We might even try to skip backing up some states entirely
if they are not relevant to optimal behavior. Some ideas for doing this are
discussed in Chapter 8.

Asynchronous algorithms also make it easier to intermix computation with
real-time interaction. To solve a given MDP, we can run an iterative DP
algorithm at the same time that an agent is actually experiencing the MDP.
The agent’s experience can be used to determine the states to which the DP
algorithm applies its backups. At the same time, the latest value and policy
information from the DP algorithm can guide the agent’s decision-making. For
example, we can apply backups to states as the agent visits them. This makes
it possible to focus the DP algorithm’s backups onto parts of the state set that
are most relevant to the agent. This kind of focusing is a repeated theme in
reinforcement learning.

CHAPTER 4. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

4.6 Generalized Policy Iteration

Policy iteration consists of two simultaneous, interacting processes, one making
the value function consistent with the current policy (policy evaluation), and
the other making the policy greedy with respect to the current value function
(policy improvement). In policy iteration, these two processes alternate, each
completing before the other begins, but this is not really necessary. In value
iteration, for example, only a single iteration of policy evaluation is performed
in between each policy improvement. In asynchronous DP methods, the eval-
uation and improvement processes are interleaved at an even ﬁner grain. In
some cases a single state is updated in one process before returning to the
other. As long as both processes continue to update all states, the ultimate
result is typically the same—convergence to the optimal value function and an
optimal policy.

We use the term generalized policy iteration (GPI) to refer to the general
idea of letting policy evaluation and policy improvement processes interact,
independent of the granularity and other details of the two processes. Almost
all reinforcement learning methods are well described as GPI. That is, all
have identiﬁable policies and value functions, with the policy always being
improved with respect to the value function and the value function always
being driven toward the value function for the policy. This overall schema for
GPI is illustrated in Figure 4.7.

It is easy to see that if both the evaluation process and the improvement
process stabilize, that is, no longer produce changes, then the value function
and policy must be optimal. The value function stabilizes only when it is con-
sistent with the current policy, and the policy stabilizes only when it is greedy
with respect to the current value function. Thus, both processes stabilize only
when a policy has been found that is greedy with respect to its own evaluation
function. This implies that the Bellman optimality equation (4.1) holds, and
thus that the policy and the value function are optimal.

The evaluation and improvement processes in GPI can be viewed as both
competing and cooperating. They compete in the sense that they pull in op-
posing directions. Making the policy greedy with respect to the value function
typically makes the value function incorrect for the changed policy, and mak-
ing the value function consistent with the policy typically causes that policy no
longer to be greedy. In the long run, however, these two processes interact to
ﬁnd a single joint solution: the optimal value function and an optimal policy.

One might also think of the interaction between the evaluation and im-
provement processes in GPI in terms of two constraints or goals—for example,
as two lines in two-dimensional space:

4.6. GENERALIZED POLICY ITERATION

105

Figure 4.7: Generalized policy iteration: Value and policy functions interact
until they are optimal and thus consistent with each other.

Although the real geometry is much more complicated than this, the diagram
suggests what happens in the real case. Each process drives the value function
or policy toward one of the lines representing a solution to one of the two
goals. The goals interact because the two lines are not orthogonal. Driving
directly toward one goal causes some movement away from the other goal.
Inevitably, however, the joint process is brought closer to the overall goal of
optimality. The arrows in this diagram correspond to the behavior of policy
iteration in that each takes the system all the way to achieving one of the two
goals completely. In GPI one could also take smaller, incomplete steps toward
each goal. In either case, the two processes together achieve the overall goal

CHAPTER 4. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

of optimality even though neither is attempting to achieve it directly.

4.7 Eﬃciency of Dynamic Programming

DP may not be practical for very large problems, but compared with other
methods for solving MDPs, DP methods are actually quite eﬃcient.
If we
ignore a few technical details, then the (worst case) time DP methods take to
ﬁnd an optimal policy is polynomial in the number of states and actions. If n
and m denote the number of states and actions, this means that a DP method
takes a number of computational operations that is less than some polynomial
function of n and m. A DP method is guaranteed to ﬁnd an optimal policy in
polynomial time even though the total number of (deterministic) policies is mn.
In this sense, DP is exponentially faster than any direct search in policy space
could be, because direct search would have to exhaustively examine each policy
to provide the same guarantee. Linear programming methods can also be used
to solve MDPs, and in some cases their worst-case convergence guarantees are
better than those of DP methods. But linear programming methods become
impractical at a much smaller number of states than do DP methods (by a
factor of about 100). For the largest problems, only DP methods are feasible.

DP is sometimes thought to be of limited applicability because of the curse
of dimensionality (Bellman, 1957a), the fact that the number of states often
grows exponentially with the number of state variables. Large state sets do
create diﬃculties, but these are inherent diﬃculties of the problem, not of DP
as a solution method. In fact, DP is comparatively better suited to handling
large state spaces than competing methods such as direct search and linear
programming.

In practice, DP methods can be used with today’s computers to solve
MDPs with millions of states. Both policy iteration and value iteration are
widely used, and it is not clear which, if either, is better in general. In practice,
these methods usually converge much faster than their theoretical worst-case
run times, particularly if they are started with good initial value functions or
policies.

On problems with large state spaces, asynchronous DP methods are of-
ten preferred. To complete even one sweep of a synchronous method requires
computation and memory for every state. For some problems, even this much
memory and computation is impractical, yet the problem is still potentially
solvable because only a relatively few states occur along optimal solution tra-
jectories. Asynchronous methods and other variations of GPI can be applied in
such cases and may ﬁnd good or optimal policies much faster than synchronous

methods can.

4.8 Summary

107

In this chapter we have become familiar with the basic ideas and algorithms of
dynamic programming as they relate to solving ﬁnite MDPs. Policy evaluation
refers to the (typically) iterative computation of the value functions for a
given policy. Policy improvement refers to the computation of an improved
policy given the value function for that policy. Putting these two computations
together, we obtain policy iteration and value iteration, the two most popular
DP methods. Either of these can be used to reliably compute optimal policies
and value functions for ﬁnite MDPs given complete knowledge of the MDP.

Classical DP methods operate in sweeps through the state set, performing
a full backup operation on each state. Each backup updates the value of one
state based on the values of all possible successor states and their probabilities
of occurring. Full backups are closely related to Bellman equations: they are
little more than these equations turned into assignment statements. When the
backups no longer result in any changes in value, convergence has occurred to
values that satisfy the corresponding Bellman equation. Just as there are
four primary value functions (vπ, v
), there are four corresponding
Bellman equations and four corresponding full backups. An intuitive view of
the operation of backups is given by backup diagrams.

Insight into DP methods and, in fact, into almost all reinforcement learn-
ing methods, can be gained by viewing them as generalized policy iteration
(GPI). GPI is the general idea of two interacting processes revolving around
an approximate policy and an approximate value function. One process takes
the policy as given and performs some form of policy evaluation, changing the
value function to be more like the true value function for the policy. The other
process takes the value function as given and performs some form of policy
improvement, changing the policy to make it better, assuming that the value
function is its value function. Although each process changes the basis for the
other, overall they work together to ﬁnd a joint solution: a policy and value
function that are unchanged by either process and, consequently, are optimal.
In some cases, GPI can be proved to converge, most notably for the classical
DP methods that we have presented in this chapter. In other cases convergence
has not been proved, but still the idea of GPI improves our understanding of
the methods.

It is not necessary to perform DP methods in complete sweeps through the
state set. Asynchronous DP methods are in-place iterative methods that back

108

CHAPTER 4. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

up states in an arbitrary order, perhaps stochastically determined and using
out-of-date information. Many of these methods can be viewed as ﬁne-grained
forms of GPI.

Finally, we note one last special property of DP methods. All of them
update estimates of the values of states based on estimates of the values of
successor states. That is, they update estimates on the basis of other estimates.
We call this general idea bootstrapping. Many reinforcement learning methods
perform bootstrapping, even those that do not require, as DP requires, a
In the next chapter we

explore reinforcement learning methods that do not require a model and do
not bootstrap. In the chapter after that we explore methods that do not require
a model but do bootstrap. These key features and properties are separable,
yet can be mixed in interesting combinations.

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

The term “dynamic programming” is due to Bellman (1957a), who showed
how these methods could be applied to a wide range of problems. Extensive
treatments of DP can be found in many texts, including Bertsekas (1995),
Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996), Dreyfus and Law (1977), Ross (1983), White
(1969), and Whittle (1982, 1983). Our interest in DP is restricted to its use
in solving MDPs, but DP also applies to other types of problems. Kumar and
Kanal (1988) provide a more general look at DP.

To the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst connection between DP and rein-
forcement learning was made by Minsky (1961) in commenting on Samuel’s
In a footnote, Minsky mentioned that it is possible to ap-
checkers player.
ply DP to problems in which Samuel’s backing-up process can be handled in
closed analytic form. This remark may have misled artiﬁcial intelligence re-
searchers into believing that DP was restricted to analytically tractable prob-
lems and therefore largely irrelevant to artiﬁcial intelligence. Andreae (1969b)
mentioned DP in the context of reinforcement learning, speciﬁcally policy iter-
ation, although he did not make speciﬁc connections between DP and learning
algorithms. Werbos (1977) suggested an approach to approximating DP called
“heuristic dynamic programming” that emphasizes gradient-descent methods
for continuous-state problems (Werbos, 1982, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1992). These
methods are closely related to the reinforcement learning algorithms that we
discuss in this book. Watkins (1989) was explicit in connecting reinforcement
learning to DP, characterizing a class of reinforcement learning methods as
“incremental dynamic programming.”

4.8. SUMMARY

109

4.1–4 These sections describe well-established DP algorithms that are covered
in any of the general DP references cited above. The policy improve-
ment theorem and the policy iteration algorithm are due to Bellman
(1957a) and Howard (1960). Our presentation was inﬂuenced by the
local view of policy improvement taken by Watkins (1989). Our discus-
sion of value iteration as a form of truncated policy iteration is based
on the approach of Puterman and Shin (1978), who presented a class
of algorithms called modiﬁed policy iteration, which includes policy it-
eration and value iteration as special cases. An analysis showing how
value iteration can be made to ﬁnd an optimal policy in ﬁnite time is
given by Bertsekas (1987).

Iterative policy evaluation is an example of a classical successive ap-
proximation algorithm for solving a system of linear equations. The
version of the algorithm that uses two arrays, one holding the old val-
ues while the other is updated, is often called a Jacobi-style algorithm,
after Jacobi’s classical use of this method. It is also sometimes called
a synchronous algorithm because it can be performed in parallel, with
separate processors simultaneously updating the values of individual
states using input from other processors. The second array is needed
to simulate this parallel computation sequentially. The in-place version
of the algorithm is often called a Gauss–Seidel-style algorithm after
the classical Gauss–Seidel algorithm for solving systems of linear equa-
tions. In addition to iterative policy evaluation, other DP algorithms
can be implemented in these diﬀerent versions. Bertsekas and Tsit-
siklis (1989) provide excellent coverage of these variations and their
performance diﬀerences.

4.5

Asynchronous DP algorithms are due to Bertsekas (1982, 1983), who
also called them distributed DP algorithms. The original motivation for
asynchronous DP was its implementation on a multiprocessor system
with communication delays between processors and no global synchro-
nizing clock. These algorithms are extensively discussed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis (1989). Jacobi-style and Gauss–Seidel-style DP algo-
rithms are special cases of the asynchronous version. Williams and
Baird (1990) presented DP algorithms that are asynchronous at a ﬁner
grain than the ones we have discussed: the backup operations them-
selves are broken into steps that can be performed asynchronously.

Exercises

Exercise 4.1 If π is the equiprobable random policy, what is qπ(11, down)?
What is qπ(7, down)?

Exercise 4.2 Suppose a new state 15 is added to the gridworld just below
state 13, and its actions, left, up, right, and down, take the agent to states
12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. Assume that the transitions from the original
states are unchanged. What, then, is vπ(15) for the equiprobable random
policy? Now suppose the dynamics of state 13 are also changed, such that
action down from state 13 takes the agent to the new state 15. What is vπ(15)
for the equiprobable random policy in this case?

Exercise 4.3 What are the equations analogous to (4.3), (4.4), and (4.5) for
the action-value function qπ and its successive approximation by a sequence of
functions q0, q1, q2, . . . ?

Exercise 4.4 In some undiscounted episodic tasks there may be policies
for which eventual termination is not guaranteed. For example, in the grid
problem above it is possible to go back and forth between two states forever.
In a task that is otherwise perfectly sensible, vπ(s) may be negative inﬁnity

evaluation given in Figure 4.1 will not terminate. As a purely practical matter,
how might we amend this algorithm to assure termination even in this case?

for free. Each additional car still costs $2, as do all cars moved in the other
direction.
If
more than 10 cars are kept overnight at a location (after any moving of cars),
then an additional cost of $4 must be incurred to use a second parking lot
(independent of how many cars are kept there). These sorts of nonlinearities

handled by optimization methods other than dynamic programming. To check

CHAPTER 4. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

Chapter 5

Monte Carlo Methods

In this chapter we consider our ﬁrst learning methods for estimating value func-
tions and discovering optimal policies. Unlike the previous chapter, here we
do not assume complete knowledge of the environment. Monte Carlo methods
require only experience—sample sequences of states, actions, and rewards from
actual or simulated interaction with an environment. Learning from actual ex-
perience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environment’s
dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior. Learning from simulated ex-
perience is also powerful. Although a model is required, the model need only
generate sample transitions, not the complete probability distributions of all
possible transitions that is required for dynamic programming (DP). In sur-
prisingly many cases it is easy to generate experience sampled according to
the desired probability distributions, but infeasible to obtain the distributions
in explicit form.

Monte Carlo methods are ways of solving the reinforcement learning prob-
lem based on averaging sample returns. To ensure that well-deﬁned returns are
available, here we deﬁne Monte Carlo methods only for episodic tasks. That is,
we assume experience is divided into episodes, and that all episodes eventually
terminate no matter what actions are selected. Only on the completion of an
episode are value estimates and policies changed. Monte Carlo methods can
thus be incremental in an episode-by-episode sense, but not in a step-by-step
(online) sense. The term “Monte Carlo” is often used more broadly for any
estimation method whose operation involves a signiﬁcant random component.
Here we use it speciﬁcally for methods based on averaging complete returns
(as opposed to methods that learn from partial returns, considered in the next
chapter).

Monte Carlo methods sample and average returns for each state–action pair
much like the bandit methods we explored in Chapter 2 sample and average

113

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

rewards for each action. The main diﬀerence is that now there are multiple
states, each acting like a diﬀerent bandit problem (like an associative-search
or contextual bandit) and that the diﬀerent bandit problems are interrelated.
That is, the return after taking an action in one state depends on the actions
taken in later states in the same episode. Because all the action selections
are undergoing learning, the problem becomes nonstationary from the point
of view of the earlier state.

To handle the nonstationarity, we adapt the idea of general policy iteration
(GPI) developed in Chapter 4 for DP. Whereas there we computed value func-
tions from knowledge of the MDP, here we learn value functions from sample
returns with the MDP. The value functions and corresponding policies still
interact to attain optimality in essentially the same way (GPI). As in the DP
chapter, ﬁrst we consider the prediction problem (the computation of vπ and
qπ for a ﬁxed arbitrary policy π) then policy improvement, and, ﬁnally, the
control problem and its solution by GPI. Each of these ideas taken from DP is
extended to the Monte Carlo case in which only sample experience is available.

5.1 Monte Carlo Prediction

We begin by considering Monte Carlo methods for learning the state-value
function for a given policy. Recall that the value of a state is the expected
return—expected cumulative future discounted reward—starting from that
state. An obvious way to estimate it from experience, then, is simply to
average the returns observed after visits to that state. As more returns are
observed, the average should converge to the expected value. This idea under-
lies all Monte Carlo methods.

In particular, suppose we wish to estimate vπ(s), the value of a state s
under policy π, given a set of episodes obtained by following π and passing
through s. Each occurrence of state s in an episode is called a visit to s. Of
course, s may be visited multiple times in the same episode; let us call the ﬁrst
time it is visited in an episode the ﬁrst visit to s. The ﬁrst-visit MC method
estimates vπ(s) as the average of the returns following ﬁrst visits to s, whereas
the every-visit MC method averages the returns following all visits to s. These
two Monte Carlo (MC) methods are very similar but have slightly diﬀerent
theoretical properties. First-visit MC has been most widely studied, dating
back to the 1940s, and is the one we focus on in this chapter. Every-visit
MC extends more naturally to function approximation and eligibility traces,
as discussed in Chapters 9 and 7. First-visit MC is shown in procedural form
in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1: The ﬁrst-visit MC method for estimating vπ. Note that we use a
capital letter V for the approximate value function because, after initialization,
it soon becomes a random variable.

Both ﬁrst-visit MC and every-visit MC converge to vπ(s) as the number
of visits (or ﬁrst visits) to s goes to inﬁnity. This is easy to see for the
case of ﬁrst-visit MC. In this case each return is an independent, identically
distributed estimate of vπ(s) with ﬁnite variance. By the law of large numbers
the sequence of averages of these estimates converges to their expected value.
Each average is itself an unbiased estimate, and the standard deviation of its
error falls as 1/√n, where n is the number of returns averaged. Every-visit
MC is less straightforward, but its estimates also converge asymptotically to
vπ(s) (Singh and Sutton, 1996).

The use of Monte Carlo methods is best illustrated through an example.

Example 5.1: Blackjack The object of the popular casino card game of
blackjack is to obtain cards the sum of whose numerical values is as great as
possible without exceeding 21. All face cards count as 10, and an ace can count
either as 1 or as 11. We consider the version in which each player competes
independently against the dealer. The game begins with two cards dealt to
both dealer and player. One of the dealer’s cards is face up and the other is
face down. If the player has 21 immediately (an ace and a 10-card), it is called
a natural. He then wins unless the dealer also has a natural, in which case the
game is a draw. If the player does not have a natural, then he can request
additional cards, one by one (hits), until he either stops (sticks) or exceeds 21
(goes bust). If he goes bust, he loses; if he sticks, then it becomes the dealer’s
turn. The dealer hits or sticks according to a ﬁxed strategy without choice:
he sticks on any sum of 17 or greater, and hits otherwise. If the dealer goes
bust, then the player wins; otherwise, the outcome—win, lose, or draw—is
determined by whose ﬁnal sum is closer to 21.

Playing blackjack is naturally formulated as an episodic ﬁnite MDP. Each
game of blackjack is an episode. Rewards of +1,
1, and 0 are given for
winning, losing, and drawing, respectively. All rewards within a game are
zero, and we do not discount (γ = 1); therefore these terminal rewards are
also the returns. The player’s actions are to hit or to stick. The states depend
on the player’s cards and the dealer’s showing card. We assume that cards
are dealt from an inﬁnite deck (i.e., with replacement) so that there is no
advantage to keeping track of the cards already dealt. If the player holds an
ace that he could count as 11 without going bust, then the ace is said to be
usable. In this case it is always counted as 11 because counting it as 1 would
make the sum 11 or less, in which case there is no decision to be made because,
obviously, the player should always hit. Thus, the player makes decisions on
the basis of three variables: his current sum (12–21), the dealer’s one showing
card (ace–10), and whether or not he holds a usable ace. This makes for a
total of 200 states.

Consider the policy that sticks if the player’s sum is 20 or 21, and other-
wise hits. To ﬁnd the state-value function for this policy by a Monte Carlo
approach, one simulates many blackjack games using the policy and averages
the returns following each state. Note that in this task the same state never
recurs within one episode, so there is no diﬀerence between ﬁrst-visit and
every-visit MC methods. In this way, we obtained the estimates of the state-
value function shown in Figure 5.2. The estimates for states with a usable ace
are less certain and less regular because these states are less common. In any
event, after 500,000 games the value function is very well approximated.

117

Although we have complete knowledge of the environment in this task, it
would not be easy to apply DP methods to compute the value function. DP
methods require the distribution of next events—in particular, they require
the quantities p(s(cid:48), r
s, a)—and it is not easy to determine these for blackjack.
|
For example, suppose the player’s sum is 14 and he chooses to stick. What is
his expected reward as a function of the dealer’s showing card? All of these
expected rewards and transition probabilities must be computed before DP
can be applied, and such computations are often complex and error-prone. In
contrast, generating the sample games required by Monte Carlo methods is
easy. This is the case surprisingly often; the ability of Monte Carlo methods
to work with sample episodes alone can be a signiﬁcant advantage even when
one has complete knowledge of the environment’s dynamics.

Can we generalize the idea of backup diagrams to Monte Carlo algorithms?
The general idea of a backup diagram is to show at the top the root node to be
updated and to show below all the transitions and leaf nodes whose rewards
and estimated values contribute to the update. For Monte Carlo estimation of
vπ, the root is a state node, and below it is the entire trajectory of transitions
along a particular single episode, ending at the terminal state, as in Figure 5.3.
Whereas the DP diagram (Figure 3.4a) shows all possible transitions, the
Monte Carlo diagram shows only those sampled on the one episode. Whereas
the DP diagram includes only one-step transitions, the Monte Carlo diagram
goes all the way to the end of the episode. These diﬀerences in the diagrams
accurately reﬂect the fundamental diﬀerences between the algorithms.

An important fact about Monte Carlo methods is that the estimates for
each state are independent. The estimate for one state does not build upon
the estimate of any other state, as is the case in DP. In other words, Monte
Carlo methods do not bootstrap as we deﬁned it in the previous chapter.

In particular, note that the computational expense of estimating the value
of a single state is independent of the number of states. This can make Monte
Carlo methods particularly attractive when one requires the value of only one
or a subset of states. One can generate many sample episodes starting from
the states of interest, averaging returns from only these states ignoring all
others. This is a third advantage Monte Carlo methods can have over DP
methods (after the ability to learn from actual experience and from simulated
experience).

Example 5.2: Soap Bubble
Suppose a wire frame forming a closed
loop is dunked in soapy water to form a
soap surface or bubble conforming at its
edges to the wire frame. If the geometry of
the wire frame is irregular but known, how
can you compute the shape of the surface?
The shape has the property that the total
force on each point exerted by neighbor-
ing points is zero (or else the shape would
change). This means that the surface’s
height at any point is the average of its heights at points in a small circle
around that point. In addition, the surface must meet at its boundaries with
the wire frame. The usual approach to problems of this kind is to put a grid
over the area covered by the surface and solve for its height at the grid points
by an iterative computation. Grid points at the boundary are forced to the
wire frame, and all others are adjusted toward the average of the heights of
their four nearest neighbors. This process then iterates, much like DP’s iter-
ative policy evaluation, and ultimately converges to a close approximation to
the desired surface.

A bubble on a wire loop

This is similar to the kind of problem for which Monte Carlo methods
were originally designed. Instead of the iterative computation described above,
imagine standing on the surface and taking a random walk, stepping randomly
from grid point to neighboring grid point, with equal probability, until you

terminal state5.2. MONTE CARLO ESTIMATION OF ACTION VALUES

119

reach the boundary. It turns out that the expected value of the height at the
boundary is a close approximation to the height of the desired surface at the
starting point (in fact, it is exactly the value computed by the iterative method
described above). Thus, one can closely approximate the height of the surface
at a point by simply averaging the boundary heights of many walks started at
the point. If one is interested in only the value at one point, or any ﬁxed small
set of points, then this Monte Carlo method can be far more eﬃcient than the
iterative method based on local consistency.

5.2 Monte Carlo Estimation of Action Values

If a model is not available, then it is particularly useful to estimate action
values (the values of state–action pairs) rather than state values. With a
model, state values alone are suﬃcient to determine a policy; one simply looks
ahead one step and chooses whichever action leads to the best combination
of reward and next state, as we did in the chapter on DP. Without a model,
however, state values alone are not suﬃcient. One must explicitly estimate the
value of each action in order for the values to be useful in suggesting a policy.
Thus, one of our primary goals for Monte Carlo methods is to estimate q
. To
achieve this, we ﬁrst consider the policy evaluation problem for action values.

∗

The policy evaluation problem for action values is to estimate qπ(s, a),
the expected return when starting in state s, taking action a, and thereafter
following policy π. The Monte Carlo methods for this are essentially the same
as just presented for state values, except now we talk about visits to a state–
action pair rather than to a state. A state–action pair s, a is said to be visited
in an episode if ever the state s is visited and action a is taken in it. The every-
visit MC method estimates the value of a state–action pair as the average of the
returns that have followed visits all the visits to it. The ﬁrst-visit MC method
averages the returns following the ﬁrst time in each episode that the state was
visited and the action was selected. These methods converge quadratically, as
before, to the true expected values as the number of visits to each state–action
pair approaches inﬁnity.

The only complication is that many state–action pairs may never be visited.
If π is a deterministic policy, then in following π one will observe returns only
for one of the actions from each state. With no returns to average, the Monte
Carlo estimates of the other actions will not improve with experience. This is
a serious problem because the purpose of learning action values is to help in
choosing among the actions available in each state. To compare alternatives
we need to estimate the value of all the actions from each state, not just the
one we currently favor.

120

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

This is the general problem of maintaining exploration, as discussed in the
context of the n-armed bandit problem in Chapter 2. For policy evaluation
to work for action values, we must assure continual exploration. One way
to do this is by specifying that the episodes start in a state–action pair, and
that every pair has a nonzero probability of being selected as the start. This
guarantees that all state–action pairs will be visited an inﬁnite number of times
in the limit of an inﬁnite number of episodes. We call this the assumption of
exploring starts.

The assumption of exploring starts is sometimes useful, but of course it
cannot be relied upon in general, particularly when learning directly from
actual interaction with an environment. In that case the starting conditions are
unlikely to be so helpful. The most common alternative approach to assuring
that all state–action pairs are encountered is to consider only policies that are
stochastic with a nonzero probability of selecting all actions in each state. We
discuss two important variants of this approach in later sections. For now, we
retain the assumption of exploring starts and complete the presentation of a
full Monte Carlo control method.

5.3 Monte Carlo Control

We are now ready to consider how Monte Carlo estimation can be used in
control, that is, to approximate optimal policies. The overall idea is to pro-
ceed according to the same pattern as in the DP chapter, that is, according to
the idea of generalized policy iteration (GPI). In GPI one maintains both an
approximate policy and an approximate value function. The value function is
repeatedly altered to more closely approximate the value function for the cur-
rent policy, and the policy is repeatedly improved with respect to the current
value function:

These two kinds of changes work against each other to some extent, as each
creates a moving target for the other, but together they cause both policy and

121

value function to approach optimality.

To begin, let us consider a Monte Carlo version of classical policy iteration.
In this method, we perform alternating complete steps of policy evaluation and
policy improvement, beginning with an arbitrary policy π0 and ending with
the optimal policy and optimal action-value function:

policy improvement. Policy evaluation is done exactly as described in the pre-
ceding section. Many episodes are experienced, with the approximate action-
value function approaching the true function asymptotically. For the moment,
let us assume that we do indeed observe an inﬁnite number of episodes and
that, in addition, the episodes are generated with exploring starts. Under
these assumptions, the Monte Carlo methods will compute each qπk exactly,
for arbitrary πk.

Policy improvement is done by making the policy greedy with respect to
the current value function. In this case we have an action-value function, and
therefore no model is needed to construct the greedy policy. For any action-
value function q, the corresponding greedy policy is the one that, for each
s

S, deterministically chooses an action with maximal action-value:

∈

π(s) = arg max

a

q(s, a).

(5.1)

Policy improvement then can be done by constructing each πk+1 as the greedy
policy with respect to qπk. The policy improvement theorem (Section 4.2) then
applies to πk and πk+1 because, for all s

S,

qπk(s, πk+1(s)) = qπk(s, argmax

qπk(s, πk(s))

= vπk(s).

As we discussed in the previous chapter, the theorem assures us that each πk+1
is uniformly better than πk, or just as good as πk, in which case they are both
optimal policies. This in turn assures us that the overall process converges
to the optimal policy and optimal value function. In this way Monte Carlo
methods can be used to ﬁnd optimal policies given only sample episodes and
no other knowledge of the environment’s dynamics.

We made two unlikely assumptions above in order to easily obtain this
guarantee of convergence for the Monte Carlo method. One was that the

122

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

episodes have exploring starts, and the other was that policy evaluation could
be done with an inﬁnite number of episodes. To obtain a practical algorithm
we will have to remove both assumptions. We postpone consideration of the
ﬁrst assumption until later in this chapter.

For now we focus on the assumption that policy evaluation operates on an
inﬁnite number of episodes. This assumption is relatively easy to remove. In
fact, the same issue arises even in classical DP methods such as iterative policy
evaluation, which also converge only asymptotically to the true value function.
In both DP and Monte Carlo cases there are two ways to solve the problem.
One is to hold ﬁrm to the idea of approximating qπk in each policy evaluation.
Measurements and assumptions are made to obtain bounds on the magnitude
and probability of error in the estimates, and then suﬃcient steps are taken
during each policy evaluation to assure that these bounds are suﬃciently small.
This approach can probably be made completely satisfactory in the sense of
guaranteeing correct convergence up to some level of approximation. However,
it is also likely to require far too many episodes to be useful in practice on any
but the smallest problems.

The second approach to avoiding the inﬁnite number of episodes nominally
required for policy evaluation is to forgo trying to complete policy evaluation
before returning to policy improvement. On each evaluation step we move the
value function toward qπk, but we do not expect to actually get close except
over many steps. We used this idea when we ﬁrst introduced the idea of GPI in
Section 4.6. One extreme form of the idea is value iteration, in which only one
iteration of iterative policy evaluation is performed between each step of policy
improvement. The in-place version of value iteration is even more extreme;
there we alternate between improvement and evaluation steps for single states.

For Monte Carlo policy evaluation it is natural to alternate between eval-
uation and improvement on an episode-by-episode basis. After each episode,
the observed returns are used for policy evaluation, and then the policy is
improved at all the states visited in the episode. A complete simple algorithm
along these lines is given in Figure 5.4. We call this algorithm Monte Carlo
ES, for Monte Carlo with Exploring Starts.

In Monte Carlo ES, all the returns for each state–action pair are accumu-
lated and averaged, irrespective of what policy was in force when they were
observed. It is easy to see that Monte Carlo ES cannot converge to any sub-
optimal policy. If it did, then the value function would eventually converge to
the value function for that policy, and that in turn would cause the policy to
change. Stability is achieved only when both the policy and the value func-
tion are optimal. Convergence to this optimal ﬁxed point seems inevitable as
the changes to the action-value function decrease over time, but has not yet

Carlo ES to blackjack. Since the episodes are all simulated games, it is easy
to arrange for exploring starts that include all possibilities. In this case one
simply picks the dealer’s cards, the player’s sum, and whether or not the
player has a usable ace, all at random with equal probability. As the initial
policy we use the policy evaluated in the previous blackjack example, that
which sticks only on 20 or 21. The initial action-value function can be zero
for all state–action pairs. Figure 5.5 shows the optimal policy for blackjack
found by Monte Carlo ES. This policy is the same as the “basic” strategy
of Thorp (1966) with the sole exception of the leftmost notch in the policy
for a usable ace, which is not present in Thorp’s strategy. We are uncertain
of the reason for this discrepancy, but conﬁdent that what is shown here is
indeed the optimal policy for the version of blackjack we have described.

5.4 Monte Carlo Control without Exploring

Starts

How can we avoid the unlikely assumption of exploring starts? The only
general way to ensure that all actions are selected inﬁnitely often is for the
agent to continue to select them. There are two approaches to ensuring this,
resulting in what we call on-policy methods and oﬀ-policy methods. On-
policy methods attempt to evaluate or improve the policy that is used to make
decisions, whereas oﬀ-policy methods evaluate or improve a policy diﬀerent
from that used to generate the data. The Monte Carlo ES method developed
above is an example of an on-policy method. In this section we show how an
on-policy Monte Carlo control method can be designed that does not use the
unrealistic assumption of exploring starts. Oﬀ-policy methods are considered
in the next section.

S and all a

In on-policy control methods the policy is generally soft, meaning that
A(s), but gradually shifted closer and
π(a
s) > 0 for all s
|
closer to a deterministic optimal policy. Many of the methods discussed in
Chapter 2 provide mechanisms for this. The on-policy method we present in
this section uses ε-greedy policies, meaning that most of the time they choose
an action that has maximal estimated action value, but with probability ε

they instead select an action at random. That is, all nongreedy actions are
, and the remaining bulk of the
given the minimal probability of selection,
, is given to the greedy action. The ε-greedy policies

are examples of ε-soft policies, deﬁned as policies for which π(a

all states and actions, for some ε > 0. Among ε-soft policies, ε-greedy policies
are in some sense those that are closest to greedy.

The overall idea of on-policy Monte Carlo control is still that of GPI. As in
Monte Carlo ES, we use ﬁrst-visit MC methods to estimate the action-value
function for the current policy. Without the assumption of exploring starts,
however, we cannot simply improve the policy by making it greedy with respect
to the current value function, because that would prevent further exploration
of nongreedy actions. Fortunately, GPI does not require that the policy be
taken all the way to a greedy policy, only that it be moved toward a greedy
policy. In our on-policy method we will move it only to an ε-greedy policy.
For any ε-soft policy, π, any ε-greedy policy with respect to qπ is guaranteed
to be better than or equal to π.

That any ε-greedy policy with respect to qπ is an improvement over any
ε-soft policy π is assured by the policy improvement theorem. Let π(cid:48) be the
ε-greedy policy. The conditions of the policy improvement theorem apply
because for any s

In essence, we have shown in the last few pages that policy iteration works
for ε-soft policies. Using the natural notion of greedy policy for ε-soft policies,
one is assured of improvement on every step, except when the best policy has
been found among the ε-soft policies. This analysis is independent of how
the action-value functions are determined at each stage, but it does assume
that they are computed exactly. This brings us to roughly the same point
as in the previous section. Now we only achieve the best policy among the
ε-soft policies, but on the other hand, we have eliminated the assumption of
exploring starts. The complete algorithm is given in Figure 5.6.

5.5 Oﬀ-policy Prediction via Importance Sam-

pling

So far we have considered methods for estimating the value functions for a
policy given an inﬁnite supply of episodes generated using that policy. Suppose
now that all we have are episodes generated from a diﬀerent policy. That is,
suppose we wish to estimate vπ or qπ, but all we have are episodes following
another policy µ, where µ
= π. We call π the target policy because learning its
value function is the target of the learning process, and we call µ the behavior
policy because it is the policy controlling the agent and generating behavior.
The overall problem is called oﬀ-policy learning because it is learning about a
policy given only experience “oﬀ” (not following) that policy.

In order to use episodes from µ to estimate values for π, we must require
that every action taken under π is also taken, at least occasionally, under µ.
That is, we require that π(a
s) > 0. This is called the
s) > 0 implies µ(a
|
|
assumption of coverage. It follows from coverage that µ must be stochastic
in states where it is not identical to π. The target policy π, on the other
hand, may be deterministic, and, in fact, this is a case of particular interest.
Typically the target policy is the deterministic greedy policy with respect to
the current action-value function estimate. This policy we hope becomes a
deterministic optimal policy while the behavior policy remains stochastic and
more exploratory, for example, an ε-greedy policy.

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

Importance sampling is a general technique for estimating expected values
under one distribution given samples from another. We apply this technique
to oﬀ-policy learning by weighting returns according to the relative probability
of their trajectories occurring under the target and behavior policies, called
the importance-sampling ratio. Given a starting state St, the probability of
the subsequent state–action trajectory, At, St+1, At+1, . . . , ST , occurring under
any policy π is

T

(cid:89)k=t

π(Ak|

Sk)p(Sk+1|

Sk, Ak),

where p is the state-transition probability function deﬁned by (3.8). Thus, the
relative probability of the trajectory under the target and behavior policies
(the importance-sampling ratio) is

(cid:81)

Note that although the trajectory probabilities depend on the MDP’s transi-
tion probabilities, which are generally unknown, all the transition probabilities
cancel and drop out. The importance sampling ratio ends up depending only
on the two policies and not at all on the MDP.

Now we are ready to give a Monte Carto algorithm that uses a batch of
observed episodes following policy µ to estimate vπ(s). It is convenient here to
number time steps in a way that increases across episode boundaries. That is,
if the ﬁrst episode of the batch ends in a terminal state at time 100, then the
next episode begins at time t = 101. This enables us to use time-step numbers
to refer to particular steps in particular episodes. In particular, we can deﬁne
the set of all time steps in which state s is visited, denoted T(s). This is for
an every-visit method; for a ﬁrst-visit method, T(s) would only include time
steps that were ﬁrst visits to s within their episode. Also, let T (t) denote the
ﬁrst time of termination following time t, and Gt denote the return after t
up through T (t). Then
T(s) are the returns that pertain to state s, and
ρT (t)
T(s) are the corresponding importance-sampling ratios. To estimate
t
{
vπ(s), we simply scale the returns by the ratios and average the results:

(5.4)

When importance sampling is done as a simple average in this way it is called
ordinary importance sampling.

5.5. OFF-POLICY PREDICTION VIA IMPORTANCE SAMPLING 129

An important alternative is weighted importance sampling, which uses a

weighted average, deﬁned as

or zero if the denominator is zero. To understand these two varieties of im-
portance sampling, consider their estimates after observing a single return. In
the weighted-average estimate, the ratio ρT (t)
for the single return cancels in
the numerator and denominator, so that the estimate is equal to the observed
return independent of the ratio (assuming the ratio is nonzero). Given that
this return was the only one observed, this is a reasonable estimate, but of
course its expectation is vµ(s) rather than vπ(s), and in this statistical sense it
is biased. In contrast, the simple average (5.4) is always vπ(s) in expectation
(it is unbiased), but it can be extreme. Suppose the ratio were ten, indicating
that the trajectory observed is ten times as likely under the target policy as
under the behavior policy. In this case the ordinary importance-sampling es-
timate would be ten times the observed return. That is, it would be quite far
from the observed return even though the episode’s trajectory is considered
very representative of the target policy.

Formally, the diﬀerence between the two kinds of importance sampling
is expressed in their variances. The variance of the ordinary importance-
sampling estimator is in general unbounded because the variance of the ratios
is unbounded, whereas in the weighted estimator the largest weight on any
single return is one. In fact, assuming bounded returns, the variance of the
weighted importance-sampling estimator converges to zero even if the variance
of the ratios themselves is inﬁnite (Precup, Sutton, and Dasgupta 2001). In
practice, the weighted estimator usually has dramatically lower variance and is
strongly preferred. A complete every-visit MC algorithm for oﬀ-policy policy
evaluation using weighted importance sampling is given at the end of the next
section in Figure 5.9.

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

Example 5.4: Oﬀ-policy Estimation of a Blackjack State Value
We applied both ordinary and weighted importance-sampling methods to es-
timate the value of a single blackjack state from oﬀ-policy data. Recall that
one of the advantages of Monte Carlo methods is that they can be used to
evaluate a single state without forming estimates for any other states. In this
example, we evaluated the state in which the dealer is showing a deuce, the
sum of the player’s cards is 13, and the player has a usable ace (that is, the
player holds an ace and a deuce, or equivalently three aces). The data was
generated by starting in this state then choosing to hit or stick at random with
equal probability (the behavior policy). The target policy was to stick only
on a sum of 20 or 21, as in Example 5.1. The value of this state under the
0.27726 (this was determined by separately
target policy is approximately
generating one-hundred million episodes using the target policy and averaging
their returns). Both oﬀ-policy methods closely approximated this value after
1000 oﬀ-policy episodes using the random policy. Figure 5.7 shows the mean
squared error (estimated from 100 independent runs) for each method as a
function of number of episodes. The weighted importance-sampling method
has much lower overall error in this example, as is typical in practice.

the value of a single blackjack state from oﬀ-policy episodes (see Example 5.4).

Figure 5.8: Ordinary importance sampling produces surprisingly unstable esti-
mates on the one-state MDP shown inset (Example 5.5). The correct estimate
here is 1, and, even though this is the expected value of a sample return (after
importance sampling), the variance of the samples is inﬁnite, and the estimates
do not convergence to this value. These results are for oﬀ-policy ﬁrst-visit MC.

Example 5.5: Inﬁnite Variance
The estimates of ordinary importance sampling will typically have inﬁnite
variance, and thus unsatisfactory convergence properties, whenever the scaled
returns have inﬁnite variance—and this can easily happen in oﬀ-policy learning
when trajectories contain loops. A simple example is shown inset in Figure 5.8.
There is only one nonterminal state s and two actions, end and back. The
end action causes a deterministic transition to termination, whereas the back
action transitions, with probability 0.9, back to s or, with probability 0.1, on
to termination. The rewards are +1 on the latter transition and otherwise
zero. Consider the target policy that always selects back. All episodes under
this policy consist of some number (possibly zero) of transitions back to s
followed by termination with a reward and return of +1. Thus the value of
s under the target policy is thus 1. Suppose we are estimating this value
from oﬀ-policy data using the behavior policy that selects end and back with
equal probability. The lower part of Figure 5.8 shows ten independent runs
of the ﬁrst-visit MC algorithm using ordinary importance sampling. Even
after millions of episodes, the estimates fail to converge to the correct value
of 1. In contrast, the weighted importance-sampling algorithm would give an
estimate of exactly 1 everafter the ﬁrst episode that was consistent with the
target policy (i.e., that ended with the back action). This is clear because

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

that algorithm produces a weighted average of the returns consistent with the
target policy, all of which would be exactly 1.

We can verify that the variance of the importance-sampling-scaled returns
is inﬁnite in this example by a simple calculation. The variance of any random
variable X is the expected value of the deviation from its mean ¯X, which can
be written

Var[X] = E

Thus, if the mean is ﬁnite, as it is in our case, the variance is inﬁnite if and
only if the expectation of the square of the random variable is inﬁnite. Thus,
we need only show that the expected square of the importance-sampling-scaled
return is inﬁnite:

To compute this expectation, we break it down into cases based on episode
length and termination. First note that, for any episode ending with the
end action, the importance sampling ratio is zero, because the target policy
would never take this action; these episodes thus contribute nothing to the
expectation (the quantity in parenthesis will be zero) and can be ignored. We
need only consider episodes that involve some number (possibly zero) of back
actions that transition back to the nonterminal state, followed by a back action
transitioning to termination. All of these episodes have a return of 1, so the
G0 factor can be ignored. To get the expected square we need only consider
each length of episode, multiplying the probability of the episode’s occurrence
by the square of its importance-sampling ratio, and add these up:

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION

133

5.6 Incremental Implementation

Monte Carlo prediction methods can be implemented incrementally, on an
episode-by-episode basis, using extensions of the techniques described in Chap-
ter 2. Whereas in Chapter 2 we averaged rewards, in Monte Carlo methods
we average returns. In all other respects exactly the same methods as used
in Chapter 2 can be used for on-policy Monte Carlo methods. For oﬀ-policy
Monte Carlo methods, we need to separately consider those that use ordinary
importance sampling and those that use weighted importance sampling.

t

In ordinary importance sampling, the returns are scaled by the importance
sampling ratio ρT (t)
(5.3), then simply averaged. For these methods we can
again use the incremental methods of Chapter 2, but using the scaled returns in
place of the rewards of that chapter. This leaves the case of oﬀ-policy methods
using weighted importance sampling. Here we have to form a weighted average
of the returns, and a slightly diﬀerent incremental algorithm is required.

Suppose we have a sequence of returns G1, G2, . . . , Gn

same state and each with a corresponding random weight Wi (e.g., Wi = ρT (t)

and keep it up-to-date as we obtain a single additional return Gn. In addition

5.7. OFF-POLICY MONTE CARLO CONTROL

135

5.7 Oﬀ-Policy Monte Carlo Control

We are now ready to present an example of the second class of learning control
methods we consider in this book: oﬀ-policy methods. Recall that the distin-
guishing feature of on-policy methods is that they estimate the value of a
policy while using it for control. In oﬀ-policy methods these two functions are
separated. The policy used to generate behavior, called the behavior policy,
may in fact be unrelated to the policy that is evaluated and improved, called
the target policy. An advantage of this separation is that the target policy
may be deterministic (e.g., greedy), while the behavior policy can continue to
sample all possible actions.

Oﬀ-policy Monte Carlo control methods use one of the techniques presented
in the preceding two sections. They follow the behavior policy while learning
about and improving the target policy. These techniques requires that the
behavior policy has a nonzero probability of selecting all actions that might
be selected by the target policy (coverage). To explore all possibilities, we
require that the behavior policy be soft (i.e., that it select all actions in all
states with nonzero probability).

Figure 5.10 shows an oﬀ-policy Monte Carlo method, based on GPI and
weighted importance sampling, for estimating q
. The target policy π is the
greedy policy with respect to Q, which is an estimate of qπ. The behavior
policy µ can be anything, but in order to assure convergence of π to the
optimal policy, an inﬁnite number of returns must be obtained for each pair
of state and action. This can be assured by choosing µ to be ε-soft.

∗

A potential problem is that this method learns only from the tails of
episodes, after the last nongreedy action. If nongreedy actions are frequent,
then learning will be slow, particularly for states appearing in the early por-
tions of long episodes. Potentially, this could greatly slow learning. There
has been insuﬃcient experience with oﬀ-policy Monte Carlo methods to assess
how serious this problem is. If it is serious, the most important way to address
it is probably by incorporating temporal-diﬀerence learning, the algorithmic
idea developed in the next chapter. Alternatively, if γ is less than 1, then the
idea developed in the next section may also help signiﬁcantly.

turns

So far our oﬀ-policy methods have formed importance-sampling ratios for
returns considered as unitary wholes. This is clearly the right thing for a
Monte Carlo method to do in the absence of discounting (i.e., if γ = 1),
but if γ < 1 then there may be something better. Consider the case where
episodes are long and γ is signiﬁcantly less than 1. For concreteness, say that
episodes last 100 steps and that γ = 0. The return from time 0 will then be
G0 = R1, and its importance sampling ratio will be a product of 100 factors,

because after the ﬁrst reward the return has already been determined. These
later factors are all independent of the return and of expected value 1; they
do not change the expected update, but they add enormously to its variance.
In some cases they could even make the variance inﬁnite. Let us now consider
an idea for avoiding this large extraneous variance.

The essence of the idea is to think of discounting as determining a proba-

degree of termination on the third step is thus (1

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

5.9 Summary

The Monte Carlo methods presented in this chapter learn value functions and
optimal policies from experience in the form of sample episodes. This gives
them at least three kinds of advantages over DP methods. First, they can be
used to learn optimal behavior directly from interaction with the environment,
with no model of the environment’s dynamics. Second, they can be used with
simulation or sample models. For surprisingly many applications it is easy to
simulate sample episodes even though it is diﬃcult to construct the kind of
explicit model of transition probabilities required by DP methods. Third, it
is easy and eﬃcient to focus Monte Carlo methods on a small subset of the
states. A region of special interest can be accurately evaluated without going
to the expense of accurately evaluating the rest of the state set (we explore
this further in Chapter 8).

A fourth advantage of Monte Carlo methods, which we discuss later in the
book, is that they may be less harmed by violations of the Markov property.
This is because they do not update their value estimates on the basis of the
value estimates of successor states. In other words, it is because they do not
bootstrap.

In designing Monte Carlo control methods we have followed the overall
schema of generalized policy iteration (GPI) introduced in Chapter 4. GPI
involves interacting processes of policy evaluation and policy improvement.
Monte Carlo methods provide an alternative policy evaluation process. Rather
than use a model to compute the value of each state, they simply average many
returns that start in the state. Because a state’s value is the expected return,
this average can become a good approximation to the value. In control meth-
ods we are particularly interested in approximating action-value functions,
because these can be used to improve the policy without requiring a model of
the environment’s transition dynamics. Monte Carlo methods intermix policy
evaluation and policy improvement steps on an episode-by-episode basis, and
can be incrementally implemented on an episode-by-episode basis.

Maintaining suﬃcient exploration is an issue in Monte Carlo control meth-
ods. It is not enough just to select the actions currently estimated to be best,
because then no returns will be obtained for alternative actions, and it may
never be learned that they are actually better. One approach is to ignore this
problem by assuming that episodes begin with state–action pairs randomly
selected to cover all possibilities. Such exploring starts can sometimes be ar-
ranged in applications with simulated episodes, but are unlikely in learning

In oﬀ-policy
methods, the agent also explores, but learns a deterministic optimal policy

that may be unrelated to the policy followed.

Oﬀ-policy Monte Carlo prediction refers to learning the value function of
a target policy from data generated by a diﬀerent behavior policy. Such learn-
ing methods are all based on some form of importance sampling, that is, on
weighting returns by the ratio of the probabilities of taking the observed ac-
tions under the two policies. Ordinary importance sampling uses a simple
average of the weighted returns, whereas weighted importance sampling uses
a weighted average. Ordinary importance sampling produces unbiased esti-
mates, but has larger, possibly inﬁnite, variance, whereas weighted importance
sampling always has ﬁnite variance and are preferred in practice. Despite their
conceptual simplicity, oﬀ-policy Monte Carlo methods for both prediction and
control remain unsettled and a subject of ongoing research.

The Monte Carlo methods treated in this chapter diﬀer from the DP meth-
ods treated in the previous chapter in two major ways. First, they operate on
sample experience, and thus can be used for direct learning without a model.
Second, they do not bootstrap. That is, they do not update their value es-
timates on the basis of other value estimates. These two diﬀerences are not
tightly linked, and can be separated. In the next chapter we consider methods
that learn from experience, like Monte Carlo methods, but also bootstrap, like
DP methods.

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

The term “Monte Carlo” dates from the 1940s, when physicists at Los Alamos
devised games of chance that they could study to help understand complex
physical phenomena relating to the atom bomb. Coverage of Monte Carlo
methods in this sense can be found in several textbooks (e.g., Kalos and Whit-
lock, 1986; Rubinstein, 1981).

An early use of Monte Carlo methods to estimate action values in a re-

balancing (Example 3.4), they used averages of episode durations to assess
the worth (expected balancing “life”) of each possible action in each state,
and then used these assessments to control action selections. Their method is
similar in spirit to Monte Carlo ES with every-visit MC estimates. Narendra
and Wheeler (1986) studied a Monte Carlo method for ergodic ﬁnite Markov
chains that used the return accumulated from one visit to a state to the next
as a reward for adjusting a learning automaton’s action probabilities.

Barto and Duﬀ (1994) discussed policy evaluation in the context of classi-
cal Monte Carlo algorithms for solving systems of linear equations. They used

140

CHAPTER 5. MONTE CARLO METHODS

the analysis of Curtiss (1954) to point out the computational advantages of
Monte Carlo policy evaluation for large problems. Singh and Sutton (1996)
distinguished between every-visit and ﬁrst-visit MC methods and proved re-
sults relating these methods to reinforcement learning algorithms.

The blackjack example is based on an example used by Widrow, Gupta,
and Maitra (1973). The soap bubble example is a classical Dirichlet problem
whose Monte Carlo solution was ﬁrst proposed by Kakutani (1945; see Hersh
and Griego, 1969; Doyle and Snell, 1984). The racetrack exercise is adapted
from Barto, Bradtke, and Singh (1995), and from Gardner (1973).

Monte Carlo ES was introduced in the 1998 edition of this book. That
may have been the ﬁrst explicit connection between Monte Carlo estimation
and control methods based on policy iteration.

Eﬃcient oﬀ-policy learning has become recognized as an important chal-
lenge that arises in several ﬁelds. For example, it is closely related to the idea
of “interventions” and “counterfactuals” in probabalistic graphical (Bayesian)
models (e.g., Pearl, 1995; Balke and Pearl, 1994). Oﬀ-policy methods using
importance sampling have a long history and yet still are not well understood.
Weighted importance sampling, which is also sometimes called normalized im-
portance sampling (e.g., Koller and Friedman, 2009), is discussed by, for ex-
ample, Rubinstein (1981), Hesterberg (1988), Shelton (2001), and Liu (2001).
Combining oﬀ-policy learning with temporal-diﬀerence learning and approxi-
mation methods introduces subtle issues that we consider in later chapters.

The target policy in oﬀ-policy learning is sometimes referred to in the
literature as the “estimation” policy, as it was in the ﬁrst edition of this book.

Our treatment of the idea of importance sampling based on truncated re-
turns is based on the analysis and “forward view” of Sutton, Mahmood, Pre-
cup, and van Hasselt (2014). A related idea is that of per-decision importance
sampling (Precup, Sutton and Singh, 2000).

oﬀ the track. Actually leaving the track is not allowed, but the position is
always advanced by at least one cell along either the horizontal or vertical
axes. With these restrictions and considering only right turns, such as shown
in the ﬁgure, all episodes are guaranteed to terminate, yet the optimal policy
is unlikely to be excluded. To make the task more challenging, we assume that
on half of the time steps the position is displaced forward or to the right by
one additional cell beyond that speciﬁed by the velocity. Apply a Monte Carlo
control method to this task to compute the optimal policy from each starting
state. Exhibit several trajectories following the optimal policy.

Temporal-Diﬀerence Learning

If one had to identify one idea as central and novel to reinforcement learning,
it would undoubtedly be temporal-diﬀerence (TD) learning. TD learning is
a combination of Monte Carlo ideas and dynamic programming (DP) ideas.
Like Monte Carlo methods, TD methods can learn directly from raw experience
without a model of the environment’s dynamics. Like DP, TD methods update
estimates based in part on other learned estimates, without waiting for a ﬁnal
outcome (they bootstrap). The relationship between TD, DP, and Monte
Carlo methods is a recurring theme in the theory of reinforcement learning.
This chapter is the beginning of our exploration of it. Before we are done,
we will see that these ideas and methods blend into each other and can be
combined in many ways. In particular, in Chapter 7 we introduce the TD(λ)
algorithm, which seamlessly integrates TD and Monte Carlo methods.

As usual, we start by focusing on the policy evaluation or prediction prob-
lem, that of estimating the value function vπ for a given policy π. For the
control problem (ﬁnding an optimal policy), DP, TD, and Monte Carlo meth-
ods all use some variation of generalized policy iteration (GPI). The diﬀerences
in the methods are primarily diﬀerences in their approaches to the prediction
problem.

6.1 TD Prediction

Both TD and Monte Carlo methods use experience to solve the prediction
problem. Given some experience following a policy π, both methods update
their estimate v of vπ for the nonterminal states St occurring in that experience.
Roughly speaking, Monte Carlo methods wait until the return following the
visit is known, then use that return as a target for V (St). A simple every-visit

where Gt is the actual return following time t, and α is a constant step-
size parameter (c.f., Equation 2.4). Let us call this method constant-α MC.
Whereas Monte Carlo methods must wait until the end of the episode to
determine the increment to V (St) (only then is Gt known), TD methods need
wait only until the next time step. At time t+1 they immediately form a target
and make a useful update using the observed reward Rt+1 and the estimate
V (St+1). The simplest TD method, known as TD(0), is

In eﬀect, the target for the Monte Carlo update is Gt, whereas the target for
the TD update is Rt+1 + γV (St+1).

Because the TD method bases its update in part on an existing estimate,
we say that it is a bootstrapping method, like DP. We know from Chapter 3

(6.4)

Roughly speaking, Monte Carlo methods use an estimate of (6.3) as a target,
whereas DP methods use an estimate of (6.4) as a target. The Monte Carlo
target is an estimate because the expected value in (6.3) is not known; a
sample return is used in place of the real expected return. The DP target
is an estimate not because of the expected values, which are assumed to be
completely provided by a model of the environment, but because vπ(St+1) is
not known and the current estimate, V (St+1), is used instead. The TD target
is an estimate for both reasons: it samples the expected values in (6.4) and it
uses the current estimate V instead of the true vπ. Thus, TD methods combine
the sampling of Monte Carlo with the bootstrapping of DP. As we shall see,
with care and imagination this can take us a long way toward obtaining the
advantages of both Monte Carlo and DP methods.

the backup diagram is updated on the basis of the one sample transition from
it to the immediately following state. We refer to TD and Monte Carlo updates
as sample backups because they involve looking ahead to a sample successor
state (or state–action pair), using the value of the successor and the reward
along the way to compute a backed-up value, and then changing the value
of the original state (or state–action pair) accordingly. Sample backups diﬀer
from the full backups of DP methods in that they are based on a single sample
successor rather than on a complete distribution of all possible successors.

Example 6.1: Driving Home Each day as you drive home from work, you
try to predict how long it will take to get home. When you leave your oﬃce,
you note the time, the day of week, and anything else that might be relevant.
Say on this Friday you are leaving at exactly 6 o’clock, and you estimate that
it will take 30 minutes to get home. As you reach your car it is 6:05, and
you notice it is starting to rain. Traﬃc is often slower in the rain, so you
reestimate that it will take 35 minutes from then, or a total of 40 minutes.
Fifteen minutes later you have completed the highway portion of your journey
in good time. As you exit onto a secondary road you cut your estimate of total
travel time to 35 minutes. Unfortunately, at this point you get stuck behind
a slow truck, and the road is too narrow to pass. You end up having to follow
the truck until you turn onto the side street where you live at 6:40. Three
minutes later you are home. The sequence of states, times, and predictions is

The rewards in this example are the elapsed times on each leg of the journey.1
We are not discounting (γ = 1), and thus the return for each state is the actual
time to go from that state. The value of each state is the expected time to go.
The second column of numbers gives the current estimated value for each state
encountered.

A simple way to view the operation of Monte Carlo methods is to plot the
predicted total time (the last column) over the sequence, as in Figure 6.3. The
arrows show the changes in predictions recommended by the constant-α MC
method (6.1), for α = 1. These are exactly the errors between the estimated
value (predicted time to go) in each state and the actual return (actual time
to go). For example, when you exited the highway you thought it would take
only 15 minutes more to get home, but in fact it took 23 minutes. Equation
6.1 applies at this point and determines an increment in the estimate of time
V (St), at this time is eight
to go after exiting the highway. The error, Gt −

1If this were a control problem with the objective of minimizing travel time, then we
would of course make the rewards the negative of the elapsed time. But since we are
concerned here only with prediction (policy evaluation), we can keep things simple by using
positive numbers.

minutes. Suppose the step-size parameter, α, is 1/2. Then the predicted time
to go after exiting the highway would be revised upward by four minutes as a
result of this experience. This is probably too large a change in this case; the
truck was probably just an unlucky break. In any event, the change can only
be made oﬀ-line, that is, after you have reached home. Only at this point do
you know any of the actual returns.

Is it necessary to wait until the ﬁnal outcome is known before learning can
begin? Suppose on another day you again estimate when leaving your oﬃce
that it will take 30 minutes to drive home, but then you become stuck in a
massive traﬃc jam. Twenty-ﬁve minutes after leaving the oﬃce you are still
bumper-to-bumper on the highway. You now estimate that it will take another
25 minutes to get home, for a total of 50 minutes. As you wait in traﬃc, you
already know that your initial estimate of 30 minutes was too optimistic. Must
you wait until you get home before increasing your estimate for the initial
state? According to the Monte Carlo approach you must, because you don’t
yet know the true return.

According to a TD approach, on the other hand, you would learn immedi-
ately, shifting your initial estimate from 30 minutes toward 50. In fact, each
estimate would be shifted toward the estimate that immediately follows it.
Returning to our ﬁrst day of driving, Figure 6.4 shows the same predictions as
Figure 6.3, except with the changes recommended by the TD rule (6.2) (these
are the changes made by the rule if α = 1). Each error is proportional to
the change over time of the prediction, that is, to the temporal diﬀerences in
predictions.

Besides giving you something to do while waiting in traﬃc, there are several
computational reasons why it is advantageous to learn based on your current
predictions rather than waiting until termination when you know the actual

return. We brieﬂy discuss some of these next.

6.2 Advantages of TD Prediction Methods

TD methods learn their estimates in part on the basis of other estimates.
They learn a guess from a guess—they bootstrap. Is this a good thing to do?
What advantages do TD methods have over Monte Carlo and DP methods?
Developing and answering such questions will take the rest of this book and
more. In this section we brieﬂy anticipate some of the answers.

Obviously, TD methods have an advantage over DP methods in that they
do not require a model of the environment, of its reward and next-state prob-
ability distributions.

The next most obvious advantage of TD methods over Monte Carlo meth-
ods is that they are naturally implemented in an on-line, fully incremental
fashion. With Monte Carlo methods one must wait until the end of an episode,
because only then is the return known, whereas with TD methods one need
wait only one time step. Surprisingly often this turns out to be a critical
consideration. Some applications have very long episodes, so that delaying all
learning until an episode’s end is too slow. Other applications are continuing
tasks and have no episodes at all. Finally, as we noted in the previous chap-
ter, some Monte Carlo methods must ignore or discount episodes on which
experimental actions are taken, which can greatly slow learning. TD meth-
ods are much less susceptible to these problems because they learn from each
transition regardless of what subsequent actions are taken.

But are TD methods sound? Certainly it is convenient to learn one guess
from the next, without waiting for an actual outcome, but can we still guar-
antee convergence to the correct answer? Happily, the answer is yes. For any
ﬁxed policy π, the TD algorithm described above has been proved to converge
to vπ, in the mean for a constant step-size parameter if it is suﬃciently small,
and with probability 1 if the step-size parameter decreases according to the
usual stochastic approximation conditions (2.7). Most convergence proofs ap-
ply only to the table-based case of the algorithm presented above (6.2), but
some also apply to the case of general linear function approximation. These
results are discussed in a more general setting in the next two chapters.

If both TD and Monte Carlo methods converge asymptotically to the cor-
rect predictions, then a natural next question is “Which gets there ﬁrst?” In
other words, which method learns faster? Which makes the more eﬃcient use
of limited data? At the current time this is an open question in the sense
that no one has been able to prove mathematically that one method converges

faster than the other. In fact, it is not even clear what is the most appro-
priate formal way to phrase this question! In practice, however, TD methods
have usually been found to converge faster than constant-α MC methods on
stochastic tasks, as illustrated in the following example.

Example 6.2: Random Walk In this example we empirically compare the
prediction abilities of TD(0) and constant-α MC applied to the small Markov
process shown in Figure 6.5. All episodes start in the center state, C, and
proceed either left or right by one state on each step, with equal probabil-
ity. This behavior is presumably due to the combined eﬀect of a ﬁxed policy
and an environment’s state-transition probabilities, but we do not care which;
we are concerned only with predicting returns however they are generated.
Episodes terminate either on the extreme left or the extreme right. When an
episode terminates on the right a reward of +1 occurs; all other rewards are
zero. For example, a typical walk might consist of the following state-and-
reward sequence: C, 0, B, 0, C, 0, D, 0, E, 1. Because this task is undiscounted
and episodic, the true value of each state is the probability of terminating
on the right if starting from that state. Thus, the true value of the cen-
ter state is vπ(C) = 0.5. The true values of all the states, A through E, are

6.3 Optimality of TD(0)

Suppose there is available only a ﬁnite amount of experience, say 10 episodes
or 100 time steps. In this case, a common approach with incremental learning
methods is to present the experience repeatedly until the method converges
upon an answer. Given an approximate value function, V , the increments
speciﬁed by (6.1) or (6.2) are computed for every time step t at which a
nonterminal state is visited, but the value function is changed only once, by
the sum of all the increments. Then all the available experience is processed
again with the new value function to produce a new overall increment, and
so on, until the value function converges. We call this batch updating because
updates are made only after processing each complete batch of training data.

Under batch updating, TD(0) converges deterministically to a single an-
swer independent of the step-size parameter, α, as long as α is chosen to be
suﬃciently small. The constant-α MC method also converges deterministically
under the same conditions, but to a diﬀerent answer. Understanding these two
answers will help us understand the diﬀerence between the two methods. Un-
der normal updating the methods do not move all the way to their respective
batch answers, but in some sense they take steps in these directions. Before
trying to understand the two answers in general, for all possible tasks, we ﬁrst
look at a few examples.

Example 6.3 Random walk under batch updating. Batch-updating versions
of TD(0) and constant-α MC were applied as follows to the random walk pre-
diction example (Example 6.2). After each new episode, all episodes seen so
far were treated as a batch. They were repeatedly presented to the algorithm,
either TD(0) or constant-α MC, with α suﬃciently small that the value func-
tion converged. The resulting value function was then compared with vπ, and
the average root mean-squared error across the ﬁve states (and across 100
independent repetitions of the whole experiment) was plotted to obtain the
learning curves shown in Figure 6.8. Note that the batch TD method was
consistently better than the batch Monte Carlo method.

Under batch training, constant-α MC converges to values, V (s), that are
sample averages of the actual returns experienced after visiting each state s.
These are optimal estimates in the sense that they minimize the mean-squared
error from the actual returns in the training set. In this sense it is surprising
that the batch TD method was able to perform better according to the root
mean-squared error measure shown in Figure 6.8. How is it that batch TD
was able to perform better than this optimal method? The answer is that the
Monte Carlo method is optimal only in a limited way, and that TD is optimal
in a way that is more relevant to predicting returns. But ﬁrst let’s develop our

intuitions about diﬀerent kinds of optimality through another example.

Example 6.4: You are the Predictor Place yourself now in the role of
the predictor of returns for an unknown Markov reward process. Suppose you
observe the following eight episodes:

A, 0, B, 0
B, 1
B, 1
B, 1

B, 1
B, 1
B, 1
B, 0

This means that the ﬁrst episode started in state A, transitioned to B with
a reward of 0, and then terminated from B with a reward of 0. The other
seven episodes were even shorter, starting from B and terminating immediately.
Given this batch of data, what would you say are the optimal predictions, the
best values for the estimates V (A) and V (B)? Everyone would probably agree
that the optimal value for V (B) is 3
4, because six out of the eight times in state
B the process terminated immediately with a return of 1, and the other two
times in B the process terminated immediately with a return of 0.

But what is the optimal value for the estimate V (A) given this data? Here
there are two reasonable answers. One is to observe that 100% of the times
the process was in state A it traversed immediately to B (with a reward of 0);
and since we have already decided that B has value 3
4, therefore A must have
value 3
4 as well. One way of viewing this answer is that it is based on ﬁrst
modeling the Markov process, in this case as

.0.05.1.15.2.250255075100TDMCBATCH TRAININGWalks / EpisodesRMS error,averagedover states6.3. OPTIMALITY OF TD(0)

153

and then computing the correct estimates given the model, which indeed in
this case gives V (A) = 3

4. This is also the answer that batch TD(0) gives.

The other reasonable answer is simply to observe that we have seen A once
and the return that followed it was 0; we therefore estimate V (A) as 0. This
is the answer that batch Monte Carlo methods give. Notice that it is also the
answer that gives minimum squared error on the training data. In fact, it gives
zero error on the data. But still we expect the ﬁrst answer to be better. If
the process is Markov, we expect that the ﬁrst answer will produce lower error
on future data, even though the Monte Carlo answer is better on the existing
data.

The above example illustrates a general diﬀerence between the estimates
found by batch TD(0) and batch Monte Carlo methods. Batch Monte Carlo
methods always ﬁnd the estimates that minimize mean-squared error on the
training set, whereas batch TD(0) always ﬁnds the estimates that would be
exactly correct for the maximum-likelihood model of the Markov process. In
general, the maximum-likelihood estimate of a parameter is the parameter
value whose probability of generating the data is greatest. In this case, the
maximum-likelihood estimate is the model of the Markov process formed in the
obvious way from the observed episodes: the estimated transition probability
from i to j is the fraction of observed transitions from i that went to j, and
the associated expected reward is the average of the rewards observed on
those transitions. Given this model, we can compute the estimate of the value
function that would be exactly correct if the model were exactly correct. This
is called the certainty-equivalence estimate because it is equivalent to assuming
that the estimate of the underlying process was known with certainty rather
than being approximated. In general, batch TD(0) converges to the certainty-
equivalence estimate.

This helps explain why TD methods converge more quickly than Monte
Carlo methods.
In batch form, TD(0) is faster than Monte Carlo methods
because it computes the true certainty-equivalence estimate. This explains
the advantage of TD(0) shown in the batch results on the random walk task
(Figure 6.8). The relationship to the certainty-equivalence estimate may also
explain in part the speed advantage of nonbatch TD(0) (e.g., Figure 6.7). Al-
though the nonbatch methods do not achieve either the certainty-equivalence

ABr = 1100%75%25%r = 0r = 0154

CHAPTER 6. TEMPORAL-DIFFERENCE LEARNING

or the minimum squared-error estimates, they can be understood as moving
roughly in these directions. Nonbatch TD(0) may be faster than constant-α
MC because it is moving toward a better estimate, even though it is not get-
ting all the way there. At the current time nothing more deﬁnite can be said
about the relative eﬃciency of on-line TD and Monte Carlo methods.

Finally, it is worth noting that although the certainty-equivalence estimate
is in some sense an optimal solution, it is almost never feasible to compute
If N is the number of states, then just forming the maximum-
it directly.
likelihood estimate of the process may require N 2 memory, and computing the
corresponding value function requires on the order of N 3 computational steps
if done conventionally. In these terms it is indeed striking that TD methods
can approximate the same solution using memory no more than N and re-
peated computations over the training set. On tasks with large state spaces,
TD methods may be the only feasible way of approximating the certainty-
equivalence solution.

6.4 Sarsa: On-Policy TD Control

We turn now to the use of TD prediction methods for the control problem.
As usual, we follow the pattern of generalized policy iteration (GPI), only this
time using TD methods for the evaluation or prediction part. As with Monte
Carlo methods, we face the need to trade oﬀ exploration and exploitation, and
again approaches fall into two main classes: on-policy and oﬀ-policy. In this
section we present an on-policy TD control method.

The ﬁrst step is to learn an action-value function rather than a state-value
function. In particular, for an on-policy method we must estimate qπ(s, a) for
the current behavior policy π and for all states s and actions a. This can
be done using essentially the same TD method described above for learning
vπ. Recall that an episode consists of an alternating sequence of states and
state–action pairs:

In the previous section we considered transitions from state to state and
learned the values of states. Now we consider transitions from state–action
pair to state–action pair, and learn the value of state–action pairs. Formally
these cases are identical: they are both Markov chains with a reward process.
The theorems assuring the convergence of state values under TD(0) also apply

(6.5)

This update is done after every transition from a nonterminal state St. If St+1
is terminal, then Q(St+1, At+1) is deﬁned as zero. This rule uses every element
of the quintuple of events, (St, At, Rt+1, St+1, At+1), that make up a transition
from one state–action pair to the next. This quintuple gives rise to the name
Sarsa for the algorithm.

It is straightforward to design an on-policy control algorithm based on the
Sarsa prediction method. As in all on-policy methods, we continually estimate
qπ for the behavior policy π, and at the same time change π toward greediness
with respect to qπ. The general form of the Sarsa control algorithm is given
in Figure 6.9.

The convergence properties of the Sarsa algorithm depend on the nature
of the policy’s dependence on q. For example, one could use ε-greedy or ε-
soft policies. According to Satinder Singh (personal communication), Sarsa
converges with probability 1 to an optimal policy and action-value function as
long as all state–action pairs are visited an inﬁnite number of times and the
policy converges in the limit to the greedy policy (which can be arranged, for
example, with ε-greedy policies by setting ε = 1/t), but this result has not yet
been published in the literature.

Example 6.5: Windy Gridworld Figure 6.10 shows a standard gridworld,
with start and goal states, but with one diﬀerence: there is a crosswind upward
through the middle of the grid. The actions are the standard four—up, down,
right, and left—but in the middle region the resultant next states are shifted
upward by a “wind,” the strength of which varies from column to column. The
strength of the wind is given below each column, in number of cells shifted

upward. For example, if you are one cell to the right of the goal, then the
action left takes you to the cell just above the goal. Let us treat this as an
undiscounted episodic task, with constant rewards of
1 until the goal state
is reached. Figure 6.11 shows the result of applying ε-greedy Sarsa to this
task, with ε = 0.1, α = 0.5, and the initial values Q(s, a) = 0 for all s, a. The
increasing slope of the graph shows that the goal is reached more and more
quickly over time. By 8000 time steps, the greedy policy (shown inset) was
long since optimal; continued ε-greedy exploration kept the average episode
length at about 17 steps, two more than the minimum of 15. Note that Monte
Carlo methods cannot easily be used on this task because termination is not
guaranteed for all policies. If a policy was ever found that caused the agent to
stay in the same state, then the next episode would never end. Step-by-step
learning methods such as Sarsa do not have this problem because they quickly
learn during the episode that such policies are poor, and switch to something
else.

6.5 Q-Learning: Oﬀ-Policy TD Control

One of the most important breakthroughs in reinforcement learning was the de-
velopment of an oﬀ-policy TD control algorithm known as Q-learning (Watkins,
1989). Its simplest form, one-step Q-learning, is deﬁned by

(cid:105)

In this case, the learned action-value function, Q, directly approximates q
,
∗
the optimal action-value function, independent of the policy being followed.
This dramatically simpliﬁes the analysis of the algorithm and enabled early
convergence proofs. The policy still has an eﬀect in that it determines which
state–action pairs are visited and updated. However, all that is required for
correct convergence is that all pairs continue to be updated. As we observed
in Chapter 5, this is a minimal requirement in the sense that any method
guaranteed to ﬁnd optimal behavior in the general case must require it. Under
this assumption and a variant of the usual stochastic approximation conditions
on the sequence of step-size parameters, Q has been shown to converge with
probability 1 to q
. The Q-learning algorithm is shown in procedural form in
Figure 6.12.

∗

What is the backup diagram for Q-learning? The rule (6.6) updates a
state–action pair, so the top node, the root of the backup, must be a small,
ﬁlled action node. The backup is also from action nodes, maximizing over all
those actions possible in the next state. Thus the bottom nodes of the backup
diagram should be all these action nodes. Finally, remember that we indicate

Example 6.6: Cliﬀ Walking
This gridworld example compares Sarsa
and Q-learning, highlighting the diﬀerence between on-policy (Sarsa) and oﬀ-
policy (Q-learning) methods. Consider the gridworld shown in the upper part
of Figure 6.13. This is a standard undiscounted, episodic task, with start and
goal states, and the usual actions causing movement up, down, right, and left.
Reward is
1 on all transitions except those into the the region marked “The
100 and sends the agent
Cliﬀ.” Stepping into this region incurs a reward of
instantly back to the start. The lower part of the ﬁgure shows the performance
of the Sarsa and Q-learning methods with ε-greedy action selection, ε = 0.1.
After an initial transient, Q-learning learns values for the optimal policy, that
which travels right along the edge of the cliﬀ. Unfortunately, this results in
its occasionally falling oﬀ the cliﬀ because of the ε-greedy action selection.
Sarsa, on the other hand, takes the action selection into account and learns
the longer but safer path through the upper part of the grid. Although Q-
learning actually learns the values of the optimal policy, its on-line performance
is worse than that of Sarsa, which learns the roundabout policy. Of course, if
ε were gradually reduced, then both methods would asymptotically converge
to the optimal policy.

CHAPTER 6. TEMPORAL-DIFFERENCE LEARNING

6.6 Games, Afterstates, and Other Special Cases

In this book we try to present a uniform approach to a wide class of tasks,
but of course there are always exceptional tasks that are better treated in a
specialized way. For example, our general approach involves learning an ac-
tion-value function, but in Chapter 1 we presented a TD method for learning
to play tic-tac-toe that learned something much more like a state-value func-
tion. If we look closely at that example, it becomes apparent that the function
learned there is neither an action-value function nor a state-value function in
the usual sense. A conventional state-value function evaluates states in which
the agent has the option of selecting an action, but the state-value function
used in tic-tac-toe evaluates board positions after the agent has made its move.
Let us call these afterstates, and value functions over these, afterstate value
functions. Afterstates are useful when we have knowledge of an initial part
of the environment’s dynamics but not necessarily of the full dynamics. For
example, in games we typically know the immediate eﬀects of our moves. We
know for each possible chess move what the resulting position will be, but not
how our opponent will reply. Afterstate value functions are a natural way to
take advantage of this kind of knowledge and thereby produce a more eﬃcient
learning method.

The reason it is more eﬃcient to design algorithms in terms of afterstates is
apparent from the tic-tac-toe example. A conventional action-value function
would map from positions and moves to an estimate of the value. But many
position–move pairs produce the same resulting position, as in this example:

In such cases the position–move pairs are diﬀerent but produce the same “af-
terposition,” and thus must have the same value. A conventional action-value
function would have to separately assess both pairs, whereas an afterstate
value function would immediately assess both equally. Any learning about the
position–move pair on the left would immediately transfer to the pair on the
right.

Afterstates arise in many tasks, not just games. For example, in queuing

XOXXO+XO+XX6.7. SUMMARY

161

tasks there are actions such as assigning customers to servers, rejecting cus-
tomers, or discarding information. In such cases the actions are in fact deﬁned
in terms of their immediate eﬀects, which are completely known. For exam-
ple, in the access-control queuing example described in the previous section,
a more eﬃcient learning method could be obtained by breaking the environ-
ment’s dynamics into the immediate eﬀect of the action, which is deterministic
and completely known, and the unknown random processes having to do with
the arrival and departure of customers. The afterstates would be the number
of free servers after the action but before the random processes had produced
the next conventional state. Learning an afterstate value function over the
afterstates would enable all actions that produced the same number of free
servers to share experience. This should result in a signiﬁcant reduction in
learning time.

It is impossible to describe all the possible kinds of specialized problems
and corresponding specialized learning algorithms. However, the principles
developed in this book should apply widely. For example, afterstate methods
are still aptly described in terms of generalized policy iteration, with a policy
and (afterstate) value function interacting in essentially the same way. In many
cases one will still face the choice between on-policy and oﬀ-policy methods
for managing the need for persistent exploration.

6.7 Summary

In this chapter we introduced a new kind of learning method, temporal-
diﬀerence (TD) learning, and showed how it can be applied to the reinforce-
ment learning problem. As usual, we divided the overall problem into a pre-
diction problem and a control problem. TD methods are alternatives to Monte
Carlo methods for solving the prediction problem. In both cases, the extension
to the control problem is via the idea of generalized policy iteration (GPI) that
we abstracted from dynamic programming. This is the idea that approximate
policy and value functions should interact in such a way that they both move
toward their optimal values.

One of the two processes making up GPI drives the value function to accu-
rately predict returns for the current policy; this is the prediction problem. The
other process drives the policy to improve locally (e.g., to be ε-greedy) with
respect to the current value function. When the ﬁrst process is based on expe-
rience, a complication arises concerning maintaining suﬃcient exploration. We
have grouped the TD control methods according to whether they deal with
this complication by using an on-policy or oﬀ-policy approach. Sarsa and
actor–critic methods are on-policy methods, and Q-learning and R-learning

162

CHAPTER 6. TEMPORAL-DIFFERENCE LEARNING

are oﬀ-policy methods.

The methods presented in this chapter are today the most widely used re-
inforcement learning methods. This is probably due to their great simplicity:
they can be applied on-line, with a minimal amount of computation, to expe-
rience generated from interaction with an environment; they can be expressed
nearly completely by single equations that can be implemented with small
computer programs.
In the next few chapters we extend these algorithms,
making them slightly more complicated and signiﬁcantly more powerful. All
the new algorithms will retain the essence of those introduced here: they will
be able to process experience on-line, with relatively little computation, and
they will be driven by TD errors. The special cases of TD methods introduced
in the present chapter should rightly be called one-step, tabular, modelfree TD
methods. In the next three chapters we extend them to multistep forms (a
link to Monte Carlo methods), forms using function approximation rather than
tables (a link to artiﬁcial neural networks), and forms that include a model of
the environment (a link to planning and dynamic programming).

Finally, in this chapter we have discussed TD methods entirely within
the context of reinforcement learning problems, but TD methods are actually
more general than this. They are general methods for learning to make long-
term predictions about dynamical systems. For example, TD methods may
be relevant to predicting ﬁnancial data, life spans, election outcomes, weather
patterns, animal behavior, demands on power stations, or customer purchases.
It was only when TD methods were analyzed as pure prediction methods, inde-
pendent of their use in reinforcement learning, that their theoretical properties
ﬁrst came to be well understood. Even so, these other potential applications
of TD learning methods have not yet been extensively explored.

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

As we outlined in Chapter 1, the idea of TD learning has its early roots in
animal learning psychology and artiﬁcial intelligence, most notably the work
of Samuel (1959) and Klopf (1972). Samuel’s work is described as a case
study in Section 15.2. Also related to TD learning are Holland’s (1975, 1976)
early ideas about consistency among value predictions. These inﬂuenced one
of the authors (Barto), who was a graduate student from 1970 to 1975 at the
University of Michigan, where Holland was teaching. Holland’s ideas led to a
number of TD-related systems, including the work of Booker (1982) and the
bucket brigade of Holland (1986), which is related to Sarsa as discussed below.

6.1–2 Most of the speciﬁc material from these sections is from Sutton (1988),

6.7. SUMMARY

163

6.3

6.4

including the TD(0) algorithm, the random walk example, and the term
“temporal-diﬀerence learning.” The characterization of the relationship
to dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods was inﬂuenced
by Watkins (1989), Werbos (1987), and others. The use of backup
diagrams here and in other chapters is new to this book. Example 6.4
is due to Sutton, but has not been published before.

Tabular TD(0) was proved to converge in the mean by Sutton (1988)
and with probability 1 by Dayan (1992), based on the work of Watkins
and Dayan (1992). These results were extended and strengthened by
Jaakkola, Jordan, and Singh (1994) and Tsitsiklis (1994) by using ex-
tensions of the powerful existing theory of stochastic approximation.
Other extensions and generalizations are covered in the next two chap-
ters.

The optimality of the TD algorithm under batch training was estab-
lished by Sutton (1988). The term certainty equivalence is from the
adaptive control literature (e.g., Goodwin and Sin, 1984). Illuminating
this result is Barnard’s (1993) derivation of the TD algorithm as a com-
bination of one step of an incremental method for learning a model of
the Markov chain and one step of a method for computing predictions
from the model.

The Sarsa algorithm was ﬁrst explored by Rummery and Niranjan
(1994), who called it modiﬁed Q-learning. The name “Sarsa” was in-
troduced by Sutton (1996). The convergence of one-step tabular Sarsa
(the form treated in this chapter) has been proved by Satinder Singh
(personal communication). The “windy gridworld” example was sug-
gested by Tom Kalt.

Holland’s (1986) bucket brigade idea evolved into an algorithm closely
related to Sarsa. The original idea of the bucket brigade involved chains
of rules triggering each other; it focused on passing credit back from
the current rule to the rules that triggered it. Over time, the bucket
brigade came to be more like TD learning in passing credit back to
any temporally preceding rule, not just to the ones that triggered the
current rule. The modern form of the bucket brigade, when simpliﬁed
in various natural ways, is nearly identical to one-step Sarsa, as detailed
by Wilson (1994).

6.5

Q-learning was introduced by Watkins (1989), whose outline of a con-
vergence proof was later made rigorous by Watkins and Dayan (1992).
More general convergence results were proved by Jaakkola, Jordan, and
Singh (1994) and Tsitsiklis (1994).

CHAPTER 6. TEMPORAL-DIFFERENCE LEARNING

R-learning is due to Schwartz (1993). Mahadevan (1996), Tadepalli
and Ok (1994), and Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996) have studied rein-
forcement learning for undiscounted continuing tasks. In the literature,
the undiscounted continuing case is often called the case of maximiz-
ing “average reward per time step” or the “average-reward case.” The
name R-learning was probably meant to be the alphabetic successor to
Q-learning, but we prefer to think of it as a reference to the learning of
relative values. The access-control queuing example was suggested by
the work of Carlstr¨om and Nordstr¨om (1997).

Exercises

Exercise 6.1 This is an exercise to help develop your intuition about why
TD methods are often more eﬃcient than Monte Carlo methods. Consider
the driving home example and how it is addressed by TD and Monte Carlo
methods. Can you imagine a scenario in which a TD update would be better on
average than an Monte Carlo update? Give an example scenario—a description
of past experience and a current state—in which you would expect the TD
update to be better. Here’s a hint: Suppose you have lots of experience
driving home from work. Then you move to a new building and a new parking
lot (but you still enter the highway at the same place). Now you are starting
to learn predictions for the new building. Can you see why TD updates are
likely to be much better, at least initially, in this case? Might the same sort
of thing happen in the original task?

Exercise 6.2 From Figure 6.6, it appears that the ﬁrst episode results in a
change in only V (A). What does this tell you about what happened on the
ﬁrst episode? Why was only the estimate for this one state changed? By
exactly how much was it changed?

Exercise 6.3 The speciﬁc results shown in Figure 6.7 are dependent on the
value of the step-size parameter, α. Do you think the conclusions about which
algorithm is better would be aﬀected if a wider range of α values were used?
Is there a diﬀerent, ﬁxed value of α at which either algorithm would have
performed signiﬁcantly better than shown? Why or why not?

Exercise 6.4 In Figure 6.7, the RMS error of the TD method seems to go
down and then up again, particularly at high α’s. What could have caused
this? Do you think this always occurs, or might it be a function of how the
approximate value function was initialized?

Exercise 6.5 Above we stated that the true values for the random walk task

are 1
6, for states A through E. Describe at least two diﬀerent
ways that these could have been computed. Which would you guess we actually
used? Why?

Exercise 6.6: Windy Gridworld with King’s Moves
Re-solve the
windy gridworld task assuming eight possible actions, including the diagonal
moves, rather than the usual four. How much better can you do with the extra
actions? Can you do even better by including a ninth action that causes no
movement at all other than that caused by the wind?

Exercise 6.7: Stochastic Wind Resolve the windy gridworld task with
King’s moves, assuming that the eﬀect of the wind, if there is any, is stochastic,
sometimes varying by 1 from the mean values given for each column. That
is, a third of the time you move exactly according to these values, as in the
previous exercise, but also a third of the time you move one cell above that,
and another third of the time you move one cell below that. For example, if
you are one cell to the right of the goal and you move left, then one-third
of the time you move one cell above the goal, one-third of the time you move
two cells above the goal, and one-third of the time you move to the goal.

Exercise 6.8 What is the backup diagram for Sarsa?

Exercise 6.9 Why is Q-learning considered an oﬀ-policy control method?

Exercise 6.10 Consider the learning algorithm that is just like Q-learning
except that instead of the maximum over next state–action pairs it uses the
expected value, taking into account how likely each action is under the current
policy. That is, consider the algorithm otherwise like Q-learning except with
the update rule

Is this new method an on-policy or oﬀ-policy method? What is the backup
diagram for this algorithm? Given the same amount of experience, would
you expect this method to work better or worse than Sarsa? What other
considerations might impact the comparison of this method with Sarsa?

Exercise 6.11 Describe how the task of Jack’s Car Rental (Example 4.2)
could be reformulated in terms of afterstates. Why, in terms of this speciﬁc
task, would such a reformulation be likely to speed convergence?

CHAPTER 6. TEMPORAL-DIFFERENCE LEARNING

Chapter 7

Eligibility Traces

Eligibility traces are one of the basic mechanisms of reinforcement learning.
For example, in the popular TD(λ) algorithm, the λ refers to the use of an
eligibility trace. Almost any temporal-diﬀerence (TD) method, such as Q-
learning or Sarsa, can be combined with eligibility traces to obtain a more
general method that may learn more eﬃciently.

There are two ways to view eligibility traces. The more theoretical view,
which we emphasize here, is that they are a bridge from TD to Monte Carlo
methods. When TD methods are augmented with eligibility traces, they pro-
duce a family of methods spanning a spectrum that has Monte Carlo methods
at one end and one-step TD methods at the other. In between are intermediate
methods that are often better than either extreme method. In this sense eli-
gibility traces unify TD and Monte Carlo methods in a valuable and revealing
way.

The other way to view eligibility traces is more mechanistic. From this
perspective, an eligibility trace is a temporary record of the occurrence of an
event, such as the visiting of a state or the taking of an action. The trace
marks the memory parameters associated with the event as eligible for un-
dergoing learning changes. When a TD error occurs, only the eligible states
or actions are assigned credit or blame for the error. Thus, eligibility traces
help bridge the gap between events and training information. Like TD meth-
ods themselves, eligibility traces are a basic mechanism for temporal credit
assignment.

For reasons that will become apparent shortly, the more theoretical view of
eligibility traces is called the forward view, and the more mechanistic view is
called the backward view. The forward view is most useful for understanding
what is computed by methods using eligibility traces, whereas the backward
view is more appropriate for developing intuition about the algorithms them-

167

168

CHAPTER 7. ELIGIBILITY TRACES

selves.
In this chapter we present both views and then establish senses in
which they are equivalent, that is, in which they describe the same algorithms
from two points of view. As usual, we ﬁrst consider the prediction problem
and then the control problem. That is, we ﬁrst consider how eligibility traces
are used to help in predicting returns as a function of state for a ﬁxed pol-
icy (i.e., in estimating vπ). Only after exploring the two views of eligibility
traces within this prediction setting do we extend the ideas to action values
and control methods.

7.1 n-Step TD Prediction

What is the space of methods lying between Monte Carlo and TD methods?
Consider estimating vπ from sample episodes generated using π. Monte Carlo
methods perform a backup for each state based on the entire sequence of
observed rewards from that state until the end of the episode. The backup of
simple TD methods, on the other hand, is based on just the one next reward,
using the value of the state one step later as a proxy for the remaining rewards.
One kind of intermediate method, then, would perform a backup based on an
intermediate number of rewards: more than one, but less than all of them
until termination. For example, a two-step backup would be based on the ﬁrst
two rewards and the estimated value of the state two steps later. Similarly,
we could have three-step backups, four-step backups, and so on. Figure 7.1
diagrams the spectrum of n-step backups for vπ, with the one-step, simple TD
backup on the left and the up-until-termination Monte Carlo backup on the
right.

The methods that use n-step backups are still TD methods because they
still change an earlier estimate based on how it diﬀers from a later estimate.
Now the later estimate is not one step later, but n steps later. Methods
in which the temporal diﬀerence extends over n steps are called n-step TD
methods. The TD methods introduced in the previous chapter all use one-step
backups, and henceforth we call them one-step TD methods.

More formally, consider the backup applied to state St as a result of the
state–reward sequence, St, Rt+1, St+1, Rt+2, . . . , RT , ST (omitting the actions
for simplicity). We know that in Monte Carlo backups the estimate of vπ(St)
is updated in the direction of the complete return:

Gt = Rt+1 + γRt+2 + γ2Rt+3 +

+ γT

t
−

· · ·

where T is the last time step of the episode. Let us call this quantity the target
of the backup. Whereas in Monte Carlo backups the target is the return, in

methods to the up-until-termination backups of Monte Carlo methods.
between are the n-step backups, based on n steps of real rewards and the
estimated value of the nth next state, all appropriately discounted.

one-step backups the target is the ﬁrst reward plus the discounted estimated
value of the next state:

sense that γVt(St+1) should take the place of the remaining terms γRt+2 +
γ2Rt+3 +
1RT , as we discussed in the previous chapter. Our point
now is that this idea makes just as much sense after two steps as it does after
one. The target for a two-step backup might be

t

−

· · ·

Rt+1 + γRt+2 + γ2Vt(St+2),

where now γ2Vt(St+2) corrects for the absence of the terms γ2Rt+3 + γ3Rt+4 +

All of these can be considered approximate returns, truncated after n steps and
then corrected for the remaining missing terms, in the above case by Vt(St+n).
Notationally, it is useful to retain full generality for the correction term. We
deﬁne the general n-step return as

the last n n-step returns of an episode are always complete returns, and an
inﬁnite-step return is always a complete return. This deﬁnition enables us
to treat Monte Carlo methods as the special case of inﬁnite-step targets. All
of this is consistent with the tricks for treating episodic and continuing tasks
equivalently that we introduced in Section 3.4. There we chose to treat the
terminal state as a state that always transitions to itself with zero reward.
Under this trick, all n-step returns that last up to or past termination have
the same value as the complete return.

An n-step backup is deﬁned to be a backup toward the n-step return. In the
tabular, state-value case, the n-step backup at time t produces the following

We deﬁne the n-step backup in terms of an increment, rather than as a

the episode, as soon as the increment is computed. In this case we write

1. This is called the error reduction property of n-step returns.
Because of the error reduction property, one can show formally that on-line and
oﬀ-line TD prediction methods using n-step backups converge to the correct
predictions under appropriate technical conditions. The n-step TD methods
thus form a family of valid methods, with one-step TD methods and Monte
Carlo methods as extreme members.

Nevertheless, n-step TD methods are rarely used because they are incon-
venient to implement. Computing n-step returns requires waiting n steps to
observe the resultant rewards and states. For large n, this can become prob-
lematic, particularly in control applications. The signiﬁcance of n-step TD
methods is primarily for theory and for understanding related methods that
are more conveniently implemented. In the next few sections we use the idea
of n-step TD methods to explain and justify eligibility trace methods.

Example 7.1: n-step TD Methods on the Random Walk Consider
using n-step TD methods on the random walk task described in Example 6.2
and shown in Figure 6.5. Suppose the ﬁrst episode progressed directly from the
center state, C, to the right, through D and E, and then terminated on the right
with a return of 1. Recall that the estimated values of all the states started
at an intermediate value, V0(s) = 0.5. As a result of this experience, a one-
step method would change only the estimate for the last state, V (E), which
would be incremented toward 1, the observed return. A two-step method,
on the other hand, would increment the values of the two states preceding
termination: V (D) and V (E) both would be incremented toward 1. A three-
step method, or any n-step method for n > 2, would increment the values
of all three of the visited states toward 1, all by the same amount. Which
n is better? Figure 7.2 shows the results of a simple empirical assessment
for a larger random walk process, with 19 states (and with a
1 outcome on
the left, all values initialized to 0). Results are shown for on-line and oﬀ-line
n-step TD methods with a range of values for n and α. The performance
measure for each algorithm and parameter setting, shown on the vertical axis,
is the square-root of the average squared error between its predictions at the
end of the episodenfor the 19 states and their true values, then averaged over

the ﬁrst 10 episodes and 100 repetitions of the whole experiment (the same
sets of walks were used for all methods). First note that the on-line methods
generally worked best on this task, both reaching lower levels of absolute error
and doing so over a larger range of the step-size parameter α (in fact, all
the oﬀ-line methods were unstable for α much above 0.3). Second, note that
methods with an intermediate value of n worked best. This illustrates how
the generalization of TD and Monte Carlo methods to n-step methods can
potentially perform better than either of the two extreme methods.

Backups can be done not just toward any n-step return, but toward any aver-
age of n-step returns. For example, a backup can be done toward a target that
is half of a two-step return and half of a four-step return: 1
(Vt(St+2)) +
2Gt+4
1
(Vt(St+4)). Any set of returns can be averaged in this way, even an in-
ﬁnite set, as long as the weights on the component returns are positive and
sum to 1. The composite return possesses an error reduction property similar
to that of individual n-step returns (7.5) and thus can be used to construct
backups with guaranteed convergence properties. Averaging produces a sub-
stantial new range of algorithms. For example, one could average one-step
and inﬁnite-step returns to obtain another way of interrelating TD and Monte
Carlo methods. In principle, one could even average experience-based back-
ups with DP backups to get a simple combination of experience-based and
model-based methods (see Chapter 8).

A backup that averages simpler component backups is called a complex
backup. The backup diagram for a complex backup consists of the backup
diagrams for each of the component backups with a horizontal line above
them and the weighting fractions below. For example, the complex backup
for the case mentioned at the start of this section, mixing half of a two-step
backup and half of a four-step backup, has the diagram:

The TD(λ) algorithm can be understood as one particular way of averaging
n-step backups. This average contains all the n-step backups, each weighted
proportional to λn
λ
to ensure that the weights sum to 1 (see Figure 7.3). The resulting backup is
toward a return, called the λ-return, deﬁned by

[0, 1], and normalized by a factor of 1

Figure 7.4 further illustrates the weighting on the sequence of n-step returns

is given the weight (1

returns are equal to Gt. If we want, we can separate these post-termination

as indicated in the ﬁgures. This equation makes it clearer what happens when
λ = 1. In this case the main sum goes to zero, and the remaining term reduces
to the conventional return, Gt. Thus, for λ = 1, backing up according to the

reduces to its ﬁrst component, the one-step TD backup, whereas if λ = 1, then
the overall backup reduces to its last component, the Monte Carlo backup.

λ-return is the same as the Monte Carlo algorithm that we called constant-α
MC (6.1) in the previous chapter. On the other hand, if λ = 0, then the
λ-return reduces to Gt+1
(Vt(St+1)), the one-step return. Thus, for λ = 0,
backing up according to the λ-return is the same as the one-step TD method,
TD(0) from the previous chapter (6.2).

As with n-step TD methods, the updating can be either on-line or oﬀ-line.
The upper row of Figure 7.6 shows the performance of the on-line and oﬀ-
line λ-return algorithms on the 19-state random walk task (Example 7.1).
The experiment was just as in the n-step case (Figure 7.2) except that here we
varied λ instead of n. Note that overall performance of the λ-return algorithms
is comparable to that of the n-step algorithms.
In both cases we get best
performance with an intermediate value of the truncation parameter, n or λ.

The approach that we have been taking so far is what we call the theoret-
ical, or forward, view of a learning algorithm. For each state visited, we look
forward in time to all the future rewards and decide how best to combine them.
We might imagine ourselves riding the stream of states, looking forward from
each state to determine its update, as suggested by Figure 7.5. After looking
forward from and updating one state, we move on to the next and never have
to work with the preceding state again. Future states, on the other hand,
are viewed and processed repeatedly, once from each vantage point preceding
them.

The λ-return algorithm is the basis for the forward view of eligibility traces
as used in the TD(λ) method. In fact, we show in a later section that, in the
oﬀ-line case, the λ-return algorithm is the TD(λ) algorithm. The λ-return
and TD(λ) methods use the λ parameter to shift from one-step TD methods
to Monte Carlo methods. The speciﬁc way this shift is done is interesting,
but not obviously better or worse than the way it is done with simple n-step
methods by varying n. Ultimately, the most compelling motivation for the λ
way of mixing n-step backups is that there in a simple algorithm—TD(λ)—for
achieving it. This is a mechanism issue rather than a theoretical one. In the

THE BACKWARD VIEW OF TD(λ)

next few sections we develop the mechanistic, or backward, view of eligibility
traces as used in TD(λ).

7.3 The Backward View of TD(λ)

In the previous section we presented the forward or theoretical view of the
tabular TD(λ) algorithm as a way of mixing backups that parametrically shifts
In this section we instead
from a TD method to a Monte Carlo method.
deﬁne TD(λ) mechanistically and show that it can closely approximate the
forward view. The mechanistic, or backward , view of TD(λ) is useful because
it is simple conceptually and computationally. In particular, the forward view
itself is not directly implementable because it is acausal, using at each step
knowledge of what will happen many steps later. The backward view provides
a causal, incremental mechanism for approximating the forward view and, in
the oﬀ-line case, for achieving it exactly.

In the backward view of TD(λ), there is an additional memory variable
associated with each state, its eligibility trace. The eligibility trace for state
R+. On each step, the
s at time t is a random variable denoted Et(s)
eligibility traces of all non-visited states decay by γλ:

Et(s) = γλEt

1(s),

−

s
∀

∈

S, s

(7.8)

where γ is the discount rate and λ is the parameter introduced in the previous
section. Henceforth we refer to λ as the trace-decay parameter. What about
the trace for St, the one state visited at time t? The classical eligibility trace
for St decays just like for any state, but is then incremented by 1:

Et(St) = γλEt

−

1(St) + 1.

(7.9)

This kind of eligibility trace is called an accumulating trace because it accu-
mulates each time the state is visited, then fades away gradually when the
state is not visited, as illustrated as illustrated below.

Eligibility traces keep a simple record of which states have recently been
visited, where “recently” is deﬁned in terms of γλ. The traces are said to indi-
cate the degree to which each state is eligible for undergoing learning changes
should a reinforcing event occur. The reinforcing events we are concerned with

accumulating eligibility tracetimes of visits to a state(cid:54)
178

CHAPTER 7. ELIGIBILITY TRACES

are the moment-by-moment one-step TD errors. For example, the TD error
for state-value prediction is

δt = Rt+1 + γVt(St+1)

Vt(St).

−

(7.10)

In the backward view of TD(λ), the global TD error signal triggers propor-
tional updates to all recently visited states, as signaled by their nonzero traces:

∆Vt(s) = αδt Et(s),

for all s

S.

∈
As always, these increments could be done on each step to form an on-line
algorithm, or saved until the end of the episode to produce an oﬀ-line algo-
rithm. In either case, equations (7.8–7.11) provide the mechanistic deﬁnition
of the TD(λ) algorithm. A complete algorithm for on-line TD(λ) is given in
Figure 7.7.

(7.11)

The backward view of TD(λ) is oriented backward in time. At each mo-
ment we look at the current TD error and assign it backward to each prior
state according to the state’s eligibility trace at that time. We might imagine
ourselves riding along the stream of states, computing TD errors, and shouting
them back to the previously visited states, as suggested by Figure 7.8. Where
the TD error and traces come together, we get the update given by (7.11).

To better understand the backward view, consider what happens at various
values of λ. If λ = 0, then by (7.9) all traces are zero at t except for the trace
corresponding to St. Thus the TD(λ) update (7.11) reduces to the simple TD

rule (6.2), which we henceforth call TD(0). In terms of Figure 7.8, TD(0) is
the case in which only the one state preceding the current one is changed by
the TD error. For larger values of λ, but still λ < 1, more of the preceding
states are changed, but each more temporally distant state is changed less
because its eligibility trace is smaller, as suggested in the ﬁgure. We say that
the earlier states are given less credit for the TD error.

If λ = 1, then the credit given to earlier states falls only by γ per step. This
turns out to be just the right thing to do to achieve Monte Carlo behavior.
For example, remember that the TD error, δt, includes an undiscounted term
of Rt+1. In passing this back k steps it needs to be discounted, like any reward
in a return, by γk, which is just what the falling eligibility trace achieves. If
λ = 1 and γ = 1, then the eligibility traces do not decay at all with time. In
this case the method behaves like a Monte Carlo method for an undiscounted,
episodic task. If λ = 1, the algorithm is also known as TD(1).

TD(1) is a way of implementing Monte Carlo algorithms that is more gen-
eral than those presented earlier and that signiﬁcantly increases their range
of applicability. Whereas the earlier Monte Carlo methods were limited to
episodic tasks, TD(1) can be applied to discounted continuing tasks as well.
Moreover, TD(1) can be performed incrementally and on-line. One disadvan-
tage of Monte Carlo methods is that they learn nothing from an episode until
it is over. For example, if a Monte Carlo control method does something that
produces a very poor reward but does not end the episode, then the agent’s
tendency to do that will be undiminished during the episode. On-line TD(1),
on the other hand, learns in an n-step TD way from the incomplete ongoing
episode, where the n steps are all the way up to the current step. If something
unusually good or bad happens during an episode, control methods based on

CHAPTER 7. ELIGIBILITY TRACES

TD(1) can learn immediately and alter their behavior on that same episode.

It is revealing to revisit the 19-state random walk example (Example 7.1)
to see how well the backward-view TD(λ) algorithm does in approximating
the ideal of the forward-view λ-return algorithm. The performances of oﬀ-line
and on-line TD(λ) with accumulating traces are shown in the upper-right and
middle-right panels of Figure 7.6. In the oﬀ-line case it has been proven that
the λ-return algorithm and TD(λ) are identical in their overall updates at the
end of the episode. Thus, the one set of results in the upper-right panel is
suﬃcient for both of these algorithms. However, recall that the oﬀ-line case
is not our main focus, as all of its performance levels are generally lower and
obtained over a narrower range of parameter values than can be obtained with
on-line methods, as we saw earlier for n-step methods in Figure 7.2 and for
λ-return methods in the upper two panels of Figure 7.6.

In the on-line case, the performances of TD(λ) with accumulating traces
(middle-right panel) are indeed much better and closer to that of the on-line
λ-return algorithm (upper-left panel). If λ = 0, then in fact it is the identical
algorithm at all α, and if α is small, then for all λ it is a close approximation to
the λ-return algorithm by the end of each episode. However, if both parameters
are larger, for example λ > 0.9 and α > 0.5, then the algorithms perform
substantially diﬀerently: the λ-return algorithm performs a little less well
whereas TD(λ) is likely to be unstable. This is not a terrible problem, as
these parameter values are higher than one would want to use anyway, but it
is a weakness of the method.

Two alternative variations of eligibility traces have been proposed to ad-
dress these limitations of the accumulating trace. On each step, all three trace
types decay the traces of the non-visited states in the same way, that is, ac-
cording to (7.8), but they diﬀer in how the visited state is incremented. The
ﬁrst trace variation is the replacing trace. Suppose a state is visited and then
revisited before the trace due to the ﬁrst visit has fully decayed to zero. With
accumulating traces the revisit causes a further increment in the trace (7.9),
driving it greater than 1, whereas, with replacing traces, the trace is simply
reset to 1:

Et(St) = 1.

(7.12)

In the special case of λ = 1, TD(λ) with replacing traces is closely related
to ﬁrst-visit Monte Carlo methods. The second trace variation, called the
dutch trace, is sort of intermediate between accumulating and replacing traces,
depending on the step-size parameter α. Dutch traces are deﬁned by

Et(St) = (1

α)γλEt

1(St) + 1.

Note that as α approaches zero, the dutch trace becomes the accumulating

Figure 7.9: The three diﬀerent kinds of traces. Accumulating traces add up
each time a state is visited, whereas replacing traces are reset to one, and
dutch traces do something inbetween, depending on α (here we show them for
α = 0.5). In all cases the traces decay at a rate of γλ per step; here we show
γλ = 0.8 such that the traces have a time constant of approximately 5 steps
(the last four visits are on successive steps).

trace, and, if α = 1, the dutch trace becomes the replacing trace. Figure 7.9
contrasts the three kinds of traces, showing the behavior of the dutch trace for
α = 1/2. The performances of TD(λ) with these two kinds of traces are shown
as additional panels in (7.6). In both cases, performance is more robust to the
parameter values than it is with accumulating traces. The performance with
dutch traces in particular achieves our goal of an on-line causal algorithm that
closely approximates the λ-return algorithm.

7.4 Equivalences of Forward and Backward Views

It is sometimes possible to prove that two learning methods originating in
diﬀerent ways are in fact equivalent in the strong sense that the value functions
they produce are exactly the same on every time step. A simple case of this is
that one-step methods and all λ-based methods are equivalent if λ = 0. This
follows immediately from the fact that their backup targets are all the same.
Another easy-to-see example is the equivalence at λ = 1 of oﬀ-line TD(λ) and
the constant-α MC methods, as noted in the previous section. Of particular
interest are equivalences between forward-view algorithms, which are often
more intuitive and clearer conceptually, and backward-view algorithms that
are eﬃcient and causal. The best example of this that we have encountered so
far is the equivalence at all λ of the oﬀ-line λ-return algorithm (forward view)
and oﬀ-line TD(λ) with accumulating traces (backward view). That was an
equivalence of value functions at the end of episodes and, because they are oﬀ-
line methods which don’t change values within an episode, it is a step-by-step
equivalence as well. This equivalence was proved formally in the ﬁrst edition

times of state visitsaccumulating tracesdutch traces (α = 0.5)replacing traces182

CHAPTER 7. ELIGIBILITY TRACES

of this book, and was veriﬁed empirically here on the 19-state random-walk
example in producing the upper-left panel of Figure 7.6.

For on-line methods (and λ > 0) the ﬁrst edition of this book established
only approximate episode-by-episode equivalences between the λ-return algo-
rithm and TD(λ). In the random-walk problem, at the end of episodes, TD(λ)
with accumulating traces is almost the same as the λ-return algorithm, but
only for small α and λ. With dutch traces the approximation is closer, but it
is still not exact even on an episode-by-episode basis (compare the upper-left
and middle left panels of Figure 7.6). Only recently has an interesting exact
equivalence been established between a λ-based forward view and an eﬃcient
backward-view implementation, in particular, between a “real-time” λ-return
algorithm and the “true online TD(λ)” algorithm (van Seijen and Sutton,
2014). This is a striking and revealing result, but a little technical. The best
way to present it is using the notation of linear function approximation, which
we develop in Chapter 9. We postpone development of the real-time λ-return
algorithm until then and present here only the backward-view algorithm.

True online TD(λ) is deﬁned by the dutch trace (Eqs. 7.13 and 7.8) and

the following value function update:

Results on the 19-state random-walk example for true online TD(λ) are

algorithm, but not necessarly better than TD(λ) with dutch traces; most of
the performance improvement seems to come from the dutch traces rather
than the slightly diﬀerent or extra terms in the equations above. Of course,
this is just one example; beneﬁts of the exact equivalence may appear on other
problems. One thing we can say in that these slight diﬀerences enable true
on-line TD(λ) with λ = 1 to be exactly equivalent by the end of the episode
to the constant-α MC method, while making updates on-line and in real-time.
The same cannot be said for any of the other methods.

7.5 Sarsa(λ)

How can eligibility traces be used not just for prediction, as in TD(λ), but for
control? As usual, the main idea of one popular approach is simply to learn
action values, Qt(s, a), rather than state values, Vt(s). In this section we show
how eligibility traces can be combined with Sarsa in a straightforward way to
produce an on-policy TD control method. The eligibility trace version of Sarsa
we call Sarsa(λ), and the original version presented in the previous chapter
we henceforth call one-step Sarsa.

The idea in Sarsa(λ) is to apply the TD(λ) prediction method to state–
action pairs rather than to states. Obviously, then, we need a trace not just
for each state, but for each state–action pair. Let Et(s, a) denote the trace for
state–action pair s, a. The traces can be any of the three types—accumulating,
replace, or dutch—and are updated in essentially the same way as before except
of course being triggered by visiting the state–action pair (here given using the
identity-indicator notation):

Figure 7.11 shows the backup diagram for Sarsa(λ). Notice the similarity to
the diagram of the TD(λ) algorithm (Figure 7.3). The ﬁrst backup looks ahead
one full step, to the next state–action pair, the second looks ahead two steps,
and so on. A ﬁnal backup is based on the complete return. The weighting of
each backup is just as in TD(λ) and the λ-return algorithm.

One-step Sarsa and Sarsa(λ) are on-policy algorithms, meaning that they
approximate qπ(s, a), the action values for the current policy, π, then improve
the policy gradually based on the approximate values for the current policy.
The policy improvement can be done in many diﬀerent ways, as we have seen
throughout this book. For example, the simplest approach is to use the ε-
greedy policy with respect to the current action-value estimates. Figure 7.12
shows the complete Sarsa(λ) algorithm for this case.

is illustrated by the gridworld example in Figure 7.13. The ﬁrst panel shows
the path taken by an agent in a single episode, ending at a location of high
reward, marked by the *. In this example the values were all initially 0, and
all rewards were zero except for a positive reward at the * location. The
arrows in the other two panels show which action values were strengthened as
a result of this path by one-step Sarsa and Sarsa(λ) methods. The one-step
method strengthens only the last action of the sequence of actions that led to
the high reward, whereas the trace method strengthens many actions of the
sequence. The degree of strengthening (indicated by the size of the arrows)
falls oﬀ (according to γλ or (1
α)γλ) with steps from the reward. In this
example, the fall oﬀ is 0.9 per step.

7.6 Watkins’s Q(λ)

When Chris Watkins (1989) ﬁrst proposed Q-learning, he also proposed a
simple way to combine it with eligibility traces. Recall that Q-learning is an
oﬀ-policy method, meaning that the policy learned about need not be the same
as the one used to select actions. In particular, Q-learning learns about the
greedy policy while it typically follows a policy involving exploratory actions—
occasional selections of actions that are suboptimal according to Q. Because
of this, special care is required when introducing eligibility traces.

Suppose we are backing up the state–action pair St, At at time t. Suppose
that on the next two time steps the agent selects the greedy action, but on
the third, at time t + 3, the agent selects an exploratory, nongreedy action. In
learning about the value of the greedy policy at St, At we can use subsequent
experience only as long as the greedy policy is being followed. Thus, we can use
the one-step and two-step returns, but not, in this case, the three-step return.
The n-step returns for all n
3 no longer have any necessary relationship to
the greedy policy.

≥

Thus, unlike TD(λ) or Sarsa(λ), Watkins’s Q(λ) does not look ahead all
the way to the end of the episode in its backup. It only looks ahead as far
as the next exploratory action. Aside from this diﬀerence, however, Watkins’s
Q(λ) is much like TD(λ) and Sarsa(λ). Their lookahead stops at episode’s end,
whereas Q(λ)’s lookahead stops at the ﬁrst exploratory action, or at episode’s
end if there are no exploratory actions before that. Actually, to be more
precise, one-step Q-learning and Watkins’s Q(λ) both look one action past the
ﬁrst exploration, using their knowledge of the action values. For example,
suppose the ﬁrst action, At+1, is exploratory. Watkins’s Q(λ) would still do
the one-step update of Qt(St, At) toward Rt+1 +γ maxa Qt(St+1, a). In general,

trates the forward view of Watkins’s Q(λ), showing all the component backups.

The mechanistic or backward view of Watkins’s Q(λ) is also very simple.
Eligibility traces are used just as in Sarsa(λ), except that they are set to zero
whenever an exploratory (nongreedy) action is taken. The trace update is
best thought of as occurring in two steps. First, the traces for all state–action
pairs are either decayed by γλ or, if an exploratory action was taken, set to 0.
Second, the trace corresponding to the current state and action is incremented
by 1. The overall result is

Unfortunately, cutting oﬀ traces every time an exploratory action is taken
loses much of the advantage of using eligibility traces. If exploratory actions
are frequent, as they often are early in learning, then only rarely will backups
of more than one or two steps be done, and learning may be little faster than
one-step Q-learning.

7.7 Oﬀ-policy Eligibility Traces using Impor-

tance Sampling

The eligibility traces in Watkins’s Q(λ) are a crude way to deal with oﬀ-
policy training. First, they treat the oﬀ-policy aspect as binary; either the
target policy is followed and traces continue normally, or it is deviated from
and traces are cut oﬀ completely; there is nothing inbetween. But the target
policy may take diﬀerent actions with diﬀerent positive probabilities, as may
the behavior policy, in which case following and deviating will be a matter of

7.8.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

189

degree. In Chapter 5 we saw how to use the ratio of the two probabilities of
taking the action to more precisely assign credit to a single action, and the
product of ratios to assign credit to a sequence.

Second, Watkins’s Q(λ) confounds bootstrapping and oﬀ-policy deviation.
Bootstrapping refers to the degree to which an algorithm builds its estimates
from other estimates, like TD and DP, or does not, like MC methods.
In
TD(λ) and Sarsa(λ), the λ parameter controls the degree of bootstrapping,
with the value λ = 1 denoting no bootstrapping, turning these TD methods
into MC methods. But the same cannot be said for Q(λ). As soon as there is a
deviation from the target policy Q(λ) cuts the trace and uses its value estimate
rather than waiting for the actual rewards—it bootstraps even if λ = 1. Ideally
we would like to totally de-couple bootstrapping from the oﬀ-policy aspect, to
use λ to specify the degree of bootstrapping while using importance sampling
to correct independently for the degree of oﬀ-policy deviation.

7.8

Implementation Issues

It might at ﬁrst appear that methods using eligibility traces are much more
complex than one-step methods. A naive implementation would require every
state (or state–action pair) to update both its value estimate and its eligibility
trace on every time step. This would not be a problem for implementations
on single-instruction, multiple-data parallel computers or in plausible neural
implementations, but it is a problem for implementations on conventional serial
computers. Fortunately, for typical values of λ and γ the eligibility traces of
almost all states are almost always nearly zero; only those that have recently
been visited will have traces signiﬁcantly greater than zero. Only these few
states really need to be updated because the updates at the others will have
essentially no eﬀect.

In practice, then, implementations on conventional computers keep track
of and update only the few states with nonzero traces. Using this trick, the
computational expense of using traces is typically a few times that of a one-
step method. The exact multiple of course depends on λ and γ and on the
expense of the other computations. Cichosz (1995) has demonstrated a fur-
ther implementation technique that further reduces complexity to a constant
independent of λ and γ. Finally, it should be noted that the tabular case is
in some sense a worst case for the computational complexity of traces. When
function approximation is used (Chapter 9), the computational advantages of
not using traces generally decrease. For example, if artiﬁcial neural networks
and backpropagation are used, then traces generally cause only a doubling of
the required memory and computation per step.

190

CHAPTER 7. ELIGIBILITY TRACES

∗7.9 Variable λ

The λ-return can be signiﬁcantly generalized beyond what we have described
so far by allowing λ to vary from step to step, that is, by redeﬁning the trace
update as

Et(s) =

(cid:26)

γ λt Et
γ λt Et

1(s)
= St;
1(s) + 1 if s = St,

if s

−

−

where λt denotes the value of λ at time t. This is an advanced topic because
the added generality has never been used in practical applications, but it is
interesting theoretically and may yet prove useful. For example, one idea is to
vary λ as a function of state: λt = λ(St). If a state’s value estimate is believed
to be known with high certainty, then it makes sense to use that estimate fully,
ignoring whatever states and rewards are received after it. This corresponds to
cutting oﬀ all the traces once this state has been reached, that is, to choosing
the λ for the certain state to be zero or very small. Similarly, states whose
value estimates are highly uncertain, perhaps because even the state estimate
is unreliable, can be given λs near 1. This causes their estimated values to
have little eﬀect on any updates. They are “skipped over” until a state that is
known better is encountered. Some of these ideas were explored formally by
Sutton and Singh (1994).

The eligibility trace equation above is the backward view of variable λs.
The corresponding forward view is a more general deﬁnition of the λ-return:

7.10 Conclusions

Eligibility traces in conjunction with TD errors provide an eﬃcient, incremen-
tal way of shifting and choosing between Monte Carlo and TD methods. Traces
can be used without TD errors to achieve a similar eﬀect, but only awkwardly.
A method such as TD(λ) enables this to be done from partial experiences and
with little memory and little nonmeaningful variation in predictions.

As we mentioned in Chapter 5, Monte Carlo methods may have advan-
tages in non-Markov tasks because they do not bootstrap. Because eligibility

(cid:54)
7.10. CONCLUSIONS

191

traces make TD methods more like Monte Carlo methods, they also can have
advantages in these cases. If one wants to use TD methods because of their
other advantages, but the task is at least partially non-Markov, then the use
of an eligibility trace method is indicated. Eligibility traces are the ﬁrst line
of defense against both long-delayed rewards and non-Markov tasks.

By adjusting λ, we can place eligibility trace methods anywhere along
a continuum from Monte Carlo to one-step TD methods. Where shall we
place them? We do not yet have a good theoretical answer to this question,
but a clear empirical answer appears to be emerging. On tasks with many
steps per episode, or many steps within the half-life of discounting, it appears
signiﬁcantly better to use eligibility traces than not to (e.g., see Figure 9.12).
On the other hand, if the traces are so long as to produce a pure Monte Carlo
method, or nearly so, then performance degrades sharply. An intermediate
mixture appears to be the best choice. Eligibility traces should be used to
bring us toward Monte Carlo methods, but not all the way there.
In the
future it may be possible to vary the trade-oﬀ between TD and Monte Carlo
methods more ﬁnely by using variable λ, but at present it is not clear how this
can be done reliably and usefully.

Methods using eligibility traces require more computation than one-step
methods, but in return they oﬀer signiﬁcantly faster learning, particularly
when rewards are delayed by many steps. Thus it often makes sense to use
eligibility traces when data are scarce and cannot be repeatedly processed, as
is often the case in on-line applications. On the other hand, in oﬀ-line appli-
cations in which data can be generated cheaply, perhaps from an inexpensive
simulation, then it often does not pay to use eligibility traces. In these cases
the objective is not to get more out of a limited amount of data, but simply
to process as much data as possible as quickly as possible. In these cases the
speedup per datum due to traces is typically not worth their computational
cost, and one-step methods are favored.

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

7.1–2 The forward view of eligibility traces in terms of n-step returns and the
λ-return is due to Watkins (1989), who also ﬁrst discussed the error
reduction property of n-step returns. Our presentation is based on
the slightly modiﬁed treatment by Jaakkola, Jordan, and Singh (1994).
The results in the random walk examples were made for this text based
on work of Sutton (1988) and Singh and Sutton (1996). The use of
backup diagrams to describe these and other algorithms in this chapter
is new, as are the terms “forward view” and “backward view.”

192

CHAPTER 7. ELIGIBILITY TRACES

TD(λ) was proved to converge in the mean by Dayan (1992), and with
probability 1 by many researchers, including Peng (1993), Dayan and
Sejnowski (1994), and Tsitsiklis (1994). Jaakkola, Jordan, and Singh
(1994), in addition, ﬁrst proved convergence of TD(λ) under on-line
updating. Gurvits, Lin, and Hanson (1994) proved convergence of a
more general class of eligibility trace methods.

7.3

TD(λ) with accumulating traces was introduced by Sutton (1988, 1984).
Replacing traces are due to Singh and Sutton (1996). Dutch traces are
due to van Seijen and Sutton (2014, in prep).

Eligibility traces came into reinforcement learning via the fecund ideas
of Klopf (1972). Our use of eligibility traces was based on Klopf’s
work (Sutton, 1978a, 1978b, 1978c; Barto and Sutton, 1981a, 1981b;
Sutton and Barto, 1981a; Barto, Sutton, and Anderson, 1983; Sutton,
1984). We may have been the ﬁrst to use the term “eligibility trace”
(Sutton and Barto, 1981). The idea that stimuli produce aftereﬀects
in the nervous system that are important for learning is very old. See
Section 14.??.

7.4

7.5

The episode-by-episode equivalence of forward and backward views,
and the relationships to Monte Carlo methods, were proved by Sutton
(1988) for undiscounted episodic tasks, then extended to the general
case in the ﬁrst edition of this book (1989). We see these as now
superceded by the analyses and step-by-step equivalences in Section
9.??.

Sarsa(λ) was ﬁrst explored as a control method by Rummery and Ni-
ranjan (1994; Rummery, 1995). Our presentation of replacing traces
omits a subtlety which is sometimes found to be beneﬁcial: clearing
(setting to zero) the traces of all the actions not taken in the state that
is visited, as suggested by Singh and Sutton (1996). This can also be
done in Q(λ). Nowadays we would recommend just using dutch traces,
which generalize better to function approximation.

7.6 Watkins’s Q(λ) is due to Watkins (1989). Peng’s Q(λ) is due to Peng
and Williams (Peng, 1993; Peng and Williams, 1994, 1996). Rummery
(1995) made extensive comparative studies of these algorithms.

Convergence has still not been proved for any control method for 0 <
λ < 1.

7.10. CONCLUSIONS

193

7.8-9 The ideas in these two sections were generally known for many years,
but beyond what is in the sources cited in the sections themselves, this
text may be the ﬁrst place they have been described. Perhaps the ﬁrst
published discussion of variable λ was by Watkins (1989), who pointed
out that the cutting oﬀ of the backup sequence (Figure 7.14) in his
Q(λ) when a nongreedy action was selected could be implemented by
temporarily setting λ to 0.

Exercises

Exercise 7.1 Why do you think a larger random walk task (19 states instead
of 5) was used in the examples of this chapter? Would a smaller walk have
shifted the advantage to a diﬀerent value of n? How about the change in left-
1? Would that have made any diﬀerence in the best
side outcome from 0 to
value of n?

−

Exercise 7.2 Why do you think on-line methods worked better than oﬀ-line
methods on the example task?

∗Exercise 7.3 In the lower part of Figure 7.2, notice that the plot for n = 3 is
diﬀerent from the others, dropping to low performance at a much lower value of
α than similar methods. In fact, the same was observed for n = 5, n = 7, and
n = 9. Can you explain why this might have been so? In fact, we are not sure
ourselves. See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ikarpov/Classes/RL/RandomWalk/
for an attempt at a thorough answer by Igor Karpov.

Exercise 7.4 The parameter λ characterizes how fast the exponential weight-
ing in Figure 7.4 falls oﬀ, and thus how far into the future the λ-return algo-
rithm looks in determining its backup. But a rate factor such as λ is sometimes
an awkward way of characterizing the speed of the decay. For some purposes it
is better to specify a time constant, or half-life. What is the equation relating
λ and the half-life, τλ, the time by which the weighting sequence will have
fallen to half of its initial value?

Exercise 7.5 (programming) Draw a backup diagram for Sarsa(λ) with
replacing traces.

Exercise 7.6 Write pseudocode for an implementation of TD(λ) that up-
dates only value estimates for states whose traces are greater than some small
positive constant.

Exercise 7.7 Write equations or pseudocode for Sarsa(λ) and/or Q(λ) with
dutch traces. Do the same for a true-on-line version.

Planning and Learning with
Tabular Methods

In this chapter we develop a uniﬁed view of methods that require a model
of the environment, such as dynamic programming and heuristic search, and
methods that can be used without a model, such as Monte Carlo and temporal-
diﬀerence methods. We think of the former as planning methods and of the
latter as learning methods. Although there are real diﬀerences between these
two kinds of methods, there are also great similarities. In particular, the heart
of both kinds of methods is the computation of value functions. Moreover, all
the methods are based on looking ahead to future events, computing a backed-
up value, and then using it to update an approximate value function. Earlier
in this book we presented Monte Carlo and temporal-diﬀerence methods as
distinct alternatives, then showed how they can be seamlessly integrated by
using eligibility traces such as in TD(λ). Our goal in this chapter is a similar
integration of planning and learning methods. Having established these as
distinct in earlier chapters, we now explore the extent to which they can be
intermixed.

8.1 Models and Planning

By a model of the environment we mean anything that an agent can use to
predict how the environment will respond to its actions. Given a state and an
action, a model produces a prediction of the resultant next state and next re-
ward. If the model is stochastic, then there are several possible next states and
next rewards, each with some probability of occurring. Some models produce
a description of all possibilities and their probabilities; these we call distri-
bution models. Other models produce just one of the possibilities, sampled

195

196CHAPTER 8. PLANNING AND LEARNING WITH TABULAR METHODS

according to the probabilities; these we call sample models. For example, con-
sider modeling the sum of a dozen dice. A distribution model would produce
all possible sums and their probabilities of occurring, whereas a sample model
would produce an individual sum drawn according to this probability distribu-
tion. The kind of model assumed in dynamic programming—estimates of the
s, a) and r(s, a, s(cid:48))—
state transition probabilities and expected rewards, p(s(cid:48)
|
is a distribution model. The kind of model used in the blackjack example in
Chapter 5 is a sample model. Distribution models are stronger than sample
models in that they can always be used to produce samples. However, in sur-
prisingly many applications it is much easier to obtain sample models than
distribution models.

Models can be used to mimic or simulate experience. Given a starting state
and action, a sample model produces a possible transition, and a distribution
model generates all possible transitions weighted by their probabilities of oc-
curring. Given a starting state and a policy, a sample model could produce an
entire episode, and a distribution model could generate all possible episodes
and their probabilities. In either case, we say the model is used to simulate
the environment and produce simulated experience.

The word planning is used in several diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent ﬁelds. We
use the term to refer to any computational process that takes a model as
input and produces or improves a policy for interacting with the modeled
environment:

Within artiﬁcial intelligence, there are two distinct approaches to planning ac-
cording to our deﬁnition. In state-space planning, which includes the approach
we take in this book, planning is viewed primarily as a search through the state
space for an optimal policy or path to a goal. Actions cause transitions from
In what we

call plan-space planning, planning is instead viewed as a search through the
space of plans. Operators transform one plan into another, and value func-
tions, if any, are deﬁned over the space of plans. Plan-space planning includes
evolutionary methods and partial-order planning, a popular kind of planning
in artiﬁcial intelligence in which the ordering of steps is not completely de-
termined at all stages of planning. Plan-space methods are diﬃcult to apply
eﬃciently to the stochastic optimal control problems that are the focus in rein-
forcement learning, and we do not consider them further (but see Section 15.6
for one application of reinforcement learning within plan-space planning).

The uniﬁed view we present in this chapter is that all state-space planning
methods share a common structure, a structure that is also present in the

planningmodelpolicy8.1. MODELS AND PLANNING

197

learning methods presented in this book. It takes the rest of the chapter to
develop this view, but there are two basic ideas: (1) all state-space planning
methods involve computing value functions as a key intermediate step toward
improving the policy, and (2) they compute their value functions by backup
operations applied to simulated experience. This common structure can be
diagrammed as follows:

Dynamic programming methods clearly ﬁt this structure: they make sweeps
through the space of states, generating for each state the distribution of pos-
sible transitions. Each distribution is then used to compute a backed-up value
and update the state’s estimated value. In this chapter we argue that vari-
ous other state-space planning methods also ﬁt this structure, with individual
methods diﬀering only in the kinds of backups they do, the order in which
they do them, and in how long the backed-up information is retained.

Viewing planning methods in this way emphasizes their relationship to the
learning methods that we have described in this book. The heart of both
learning and planning methods is the estimation of value functions by backup
operations. The diﬀerence is that whereas planning uses simulated experience
generated by a model, learning methods use real experience generated by the
environment. Of course this diﬀerence leads to a number of other diﬀerences,
for example, in how performance is assessed and in how ﬂexibly experience
can be generated. But the common structure means that many ideas and
algorithms can be transferred between planning and learning. In particular,
in many cases a learning algorithm can be substituted for the key backup step
of a planning method. Learning methods require only experience as input, and
in many cases they can be applied to simulated experience just as well as to real
experience. Figure 8.1 shows a simple example of a planning method based on
one-step tabular Q-learning and on random samples from a sample model. This
method, which we call random-sample one-step tabular Q-planning, converges
to the optimal policy for the model under the same conditions that one-step
tabular Q-learning converges to the optimal policy for the real environment
(each state–action pair must be selected an inﬁnite number of times in Step
1, and α must decrease appropriately over time).

In addition to the uniﬁed view of planning and learning methods, a second
theme in this chapter is the beneﬁts of planning in small, incremental steps.
This enables planning to be interrupted or redirected at any time with lit-
tle wasted computation, which appears to be a key requirement for eﬃciently
intermixing planning with acting and with learning of the model. More sur-
prisingly, later in this chapter we present evidence that planning in very small

steps may be the most eﬃcient approach even on pure planning problems if
the problem is too large to be solved exactly.

8.2 Integrating Planning, Acting, and Learn-

ing

When planning is done on-line, while interacting with the environment, a num-
ber of interesting issues arise. New information gained from the interaction
may change the model and thereby interact with planning. It may be desirable
to customize the planning process in some way to the states or decisions cur-
rently under consideration, or expected in the near future. If decision-making
and model-learning are both computation-intensive processes, then the avail-
able computational resources may need to be divided between them. To begin
exploring these issues, in this section we present Dyna-Q, a simple architec-
ture integrating the major functions needed in an on-line planning agent. Each
function appears in Dyna-Q in a simple, almost trivial, form. In subsequent
sections we elaborate some of the alternate ways of achieving each function
and the trade-oﬀs between them. For now, we seek merely to illustrate the
ideas and stimulate your intuition.

Within a planning agent, there are at least two roles for real experience: it
can be used to improve the model (to make it more accurately match the real
environment) and it can be used to directly improve the value function and
policy using the kinds of reinforcement learning methods we have discussed in
previous chapters. The former we call model-learning, and the latter we call
direct reinforcement learning (direct RL). The possible relationships between
experience, model, values, and policy are summarized in Figure 8.2. Each
arrow shows a relationship of inﬂuence and presumed improvement. Note how
experience can improve value and policy functions either directly or indirectly
via the model. It is the latter, which is sometimes called indirect reinforcement
learning, that is involved in planning.

8.2.

INTEGRATING PLANNING, ACTING, AND LEARNING

199

Figure 8.2: Relationships among learning, planning, and acting.

Both direct and indirect methods have advantages and disadvantages. In-
direct methods often make fuller use of a limited amount of experience and
thus achieve a better policy with fewer environmental interactions. On the
other hand, direct methods are much simpler and are not aﬀected by biases
in the design of the model. Some have argued that indirect methods are al-
ways superior to direct ones, while others have argued that direct methods
are responsible for most human and animal learning. Related debates in psy-
chology and AI concern the relative importance of cognition as opposed to
trial-and-error learning, and of deliberative planning as opposed to reactive
decision-making. Our view is that the contrast between the alternatives in
all these debates has been exaggerated, that more insight can be gained by
recognizing the similarities between these two sides than by opposing them.
For example, in this book we have emphasized the deep similarities between
dynamic programming and temporal-diﬀerence methods, even though one was
designed for planning and the other for modelfree learning.

Dyna-Q includes all of the processes shown in Figure 8.2—planning, act-
ing, model-learning, and direct RL—all occurring continually. The planning
method is the random-sample one-step tabular Q-planning method given in
Figure 8.1. The direct RL method is one-step tabular Q-learning. The model-
learning method is also table-based and assumes the world is deterministic.
After each transition St, At (cid:32) Rt+1, St+1, the model records in its table entry
for St, At the prediction that Rt+1, St+1 will deterministically follow. Thus, if
the model is queried with a state–action pair that has been experienced before,
it simply returns the last-observed next state and next reward as its predic-
tion. During planning, the Q-planning algorithm randomly samples only from
state–action pairs that have previously been experienced (in Step 1), so the
model is never queried with a pair about which it has no information.

Figure 8.3: The general Dyna Architecture

one example, is shown in Figure 8.3. The central column represents the basic
interaction between agent and environment, giving rise to a trajectory of real
experience. The arrow on the left of the ﬁgure represents direct reinforcement
learning operating on real experience to improve the value function and the
policy. On the right are model-based processes. The model is learned from real
experience and gives rise to simulated experience. We use the term search con-
trol to refer to the process that selects the starting states and actions for the
simulated experiences generated by the model. Finally, planning is achieved
by applying reinforcement learning methods to the simulated experiences just
as if they had really happened. Typically, as in Dyna-Q, the same reinforce-
ment learning method is used both for learning from real experience and for
planning from simulated experience. The reinforcement learning method is
thus the “ﬁnal common path” for both learning and planning. Learning and
planning are deeply integrated in the sense that they share almost all the same
machinery, diﬀering only in the source of their experience.

Conceptually, planning, acting, model-learning, and direct RL occur simul-
taneously and in parallel in Dyna agents. For concreteness and implementation
on a serial computer, however, we fully specify the order in which they occur
within a time step. In Dyna-Q, the acting, model-learning, and direct RL pro-
cesses require little computation, and we assume they consume just a fraction
of the time. The remaining time in each step can be devoted to the planning
process, which is inherently computation-intensive. Let us assume that there
is time in each step, after acting, model-learning, and direct RL, to complete
n iterations (Steps 1–3) of the Q-planning algorithm. Figure 8.4 shows the
complete algorithm for Dyna-Q.

ment learning, model-learning, and planning are implemented by steps (d),
(e), and (f), respectively. If (e) and (f) were omitted, the remaining algorithm
would be one-step tabular Q-learning.

Example 8.1: Dyna Maze
Consider the simple maze shown inset in
Figure 8.5. In each of the 47 states there are four actions, up, down, right, and
left, which take the agent deterministically to the corresponding neighboring
states, except when movement is blocked by an obstacle or the edge of the
maze, in which case the agent remains where it is. Reward is zero on all
transitions, except those into the goal state, on which it is +1. After reaching
the goal state (G), the agent returns to the start state (S) to begin a new
episode. This is a discounted, episodic task with γ = 0.95.

The main part of Figure 8.5 shows average learning curves from an ex-
periment in which Dyna-Q agents were applied to the maze task. The initial
action values were zero, the step-size parameter was α = 0.1, and the explo-
ration parameter was (cid:15) = 0.1. When selecting greedily among actions, ties
were broken randomly. The agents varied in the number of planning steps,
n, they performed per real step. For each n, the curves show the number of
steps taken by the agent in each episode, averaged over 30 repetitions of the
experiment. In each repetition, the initial seed for the random number gen-
erator was held constant across algorithms. Because of this, the ﬁrst episode
was exactly the same (about 1700 steps) for all values of n, and its data are
not shown in the ﬁgure. After the ﬁrst episode, performance improved for all
values of n, but much more rapidly for larger values. Recall that the n = 0
agent is a nonplanning agent, utilizing only direct reinforcement learning (one-
step tabular Q-learning). This was by far the slowest agent on this problem,
despite the fact that the parameter values (α and ε) were optimized for it. The

agents varying in their number of planning steps (n) per real step. The task
is to travel from S to G as quickly as possible.

nonplanning agent took about 25 episodes to reach (ε-)optimal performance,
whereas the n = 5 agent took about ﬁve episodes, and the n = 50 agent took
only three episodes.

Figure 8.6 shows why the planning agents found the solution so much faster
than the nonplanning agent. Shown are the policies found by the n = 0 and
n = 50 agents halfway through the second episode. Without planning (n = 0),
each episode adds only one additional step to the policy, and so only one step
(the last) has been learned so far. With planning, again only one step is learned
during the ﬁrst episode, but here during the second episode an extensive policy
has been developed that by the episode’s end will reach almost back to the
start state. This policy is built by the planning process while the agent is still
wandering near the start state. By the end of the third episode a complete
optimal policy will have been found and perfect performance attained.

In Dyna-Q, learning and planning are accomplished by exactly the same al-
gorithm, operating on real experience for learning and on simulated experience
for planning. Because planning proceeds incrementally, it is trivial to intermix
planning and acting. Both proceed as fast as they can. The agent is always
reactive and always deliberative, responding instantly to the latest sensory
information and yet always planning in the background. Also ongoing in the

background is the model-learning process. As new information is gained, the
model is updated to better match reality. As the model changes, the ongoing
planning process will gradually compute a diﬀerent way of behaving to match
the new model.

8.3 When the Model Is Wrong

In the maze example presented in the previous section, the changes in the
model were relatively modest. The model started out empty, and was then
ﬁlled only with exactly correct information. In general, we cannot expect to be
so fortunate. Models may be incorrect because the environment is stochastic
and only a limited number of samples have been observed, because the model
was learned using function approximation that has generalized imperfectly, or
simply because the environment has changed and its new behavior has not
yet been observed. When the model is incorrect, the planning process will
compute a suboptimal policy.

In some cases, the suboptimal policy computed by planning quickly leads
to the discovery and correction of the modeling error. This tends to happen
when the model is optimistic in the sense of predicting greater reward or better
state transitions than are actually possible. The planned policy attempts to
exploit these opportunities and in doing so discovers that they do not exist.

Example 8.2: Blocking Maze A maze example illustrating this relatively
minor kind of modeling error and recovery from it is shown in Figure 8.7.
Initially, there is a short path from start to goal, to the right of the barrier,
as shown in the upper left of the ﬁgure. After 1000 time steps, the short
path is “blocked,” and a longer path is opened up along the left-hand side of

the barrier, as shown in upper right of the ﬁgure. The graph shows average
cumulative reward for Dyna-Q and two other Dyna agents. The ﬁrst part of the
graph shows that all three Dyna agents found the short path within 1000 steps.
When the environment changed, the graphs become ﬂat, indicating a period
during which the agents obtained no reward because they were wandering
around behind the barrier. After a while, however, they were able to ﬁnd the
new opening and the new optimal behavior.

Greater diﬃculties arise when the environment changes to become better
than it was before, and yet the formerly correct policy does not reveal the
improvement.
In these cases the modeling error may not be detected for a
long time, if ever, as we see in the next example.

Example 8.3: Shortcut Maze The problem caused by this kind of en-
vironmental change is illustrated by the maze example shown in Figure 8.8.
Initially, the optimal path is to go around the left side of the barrier (upper
left). After 3000 steps, however, a shorter path is opened up along the right
side, without disturbing the longer path (upper right). The graph shows that
two of the three Dyna agents never switched to the shortcut. In fact, they
never realized that it existed. Their models said that there was no short-
cut, so the more they planned, the less likely they were to step to the right

rest.

and discover it. Even with an ε-greedy policy, it is very unlikely that an
agent will take so many exploratory actions as to discover the shortcut.

The general problem here is another version of the conﬂict between ex-
ploration and exploitation. In a planning context, exploration means trying
actions that improve the model, whereas exploitation means behaving in the
optimal way given the current model. We want the agent to explore to ﬁnd
changes in the environment, but not so much that performance is greatly de-
graded. As in the earlier exploration/exploitation conﬂict, there probably is
no solution that is both perfect and practical, but simple heuristics are often
eﬀective.

The Dyna-Q+ agent that did solve the shortcut maze uses one such heuris-
tic. This agent keeps track for each state–action pair of how many time steps
have elapsed since the pair was last tried in a real interaction with the envi-
ronment. The more time that has elapsed, the greater (we might presume)
the chance that the dynamics of this pair has changed and that the model of
it is incorrect. To encourage behavior that tests long-untried actions, a spe-
cial “bonus reward” is given on simulated experiences involving these actions.
In particular, if the modeled reward for a transition is R, and the transition
has not been tried in τ time steps, then planning backups are done as if that
transition produced a reward of R + κ√τ , for some small κ. This encour-
ages the agent to keep testing all accessible state transitions and even to plan

CumulativerewardSGGS030006000Time steps4000Dyna-Q+Dyna-QDyna-AC206CHAPTER 8. PLANNING AND LEARNING WITH TABULAR METHODS

long sequences of actions in order to carry out such tests.1 Of course all this
testing has its cost, but in many cases, as in the shortcut maze, this kind of
computational curiosity is well worth the extra exploration.

8.4 Prioritized Sweeping

In the Dyna agents presented in the preceding sections, simulated transitions
are started in state–action pairs selected uniformly at random from all pre-
viously experienced pairs. But a uniform selection is usually not the best;
planning can be much more eﬃcient if simulated transitions and backups are
focused on particular state–action pairs. For example, consider what happens
during the second episode of the ﬁrst maze task (Figure 8.6). At the beginning
of the second episode, only the state–action pair leading directly into the goal
has a positive value; the values of all other pairs are still zero. This means
that it is pointless to back up along almost all transitions, because they take
the agent from one zero-valued state to another, and thus the backups would
have no eﬀect. Only a backup along a transition into the state just prior to
the goal, or from it into the goal, will change any values. If simulated transi-
tions are generated uniformly, then many wasteful backups will be made before
stumbling onto one of the two useful ones. As planning progresses, the region
of useful backups grows, but planning is still far less eﬃcient than it would
be if focused where it would do the most good. In the much larger problems
that are our real objective, the number of states is so large that an unfocused
search would be extremely ineﬃcient.

This example suggests that search might be usefully focused by working
backward from goal states. Of course, we do not really want to use any methods
speciﬁc to the idea of “goal state.” We want methods that work for general
reward functions. Goal states are just a special case, convenient for stimulating
intuition. In general, we want to work back not just from goal states but from
any state whose value has changed. Assume that the values are initially correct
given the model, as they were in the maze example prior to discovering the
goal. Suppose now that the agent discovers a change in the environment and
changes its estimated value of one state. Typically, this will imply that the
values of many other states should also be changed, but the only useful one-
step backups are those of actions that lead directly into the one state whose
value has already been changed. If the values of these actions are updated,

1The Dyna-Q+ agent was changed in two other ways as well. First, actions that had
never before been tried before from a state were allowed to be considered in the planning
step (f) of Figure 8.4. Second, the initial model for such actions was that they would lead
back to the same state with a reward of zero.

8.4. PRIORITIZED SWEEPING

207

then the values of the predecessor states may change in turn. If so, then actions
leading into them need to be backed up, and then their predecessor states may
have changed. In this way one can work backward from arbitrary states that
have changed in value, either performing useful backups or terminating the
propagation.

As the frontier of useful backups propagates backward,

it often grows
rapidly, producing many state–action pairs that could usefully be backed up.
But not all of these will be equally useful. The values of some states may
have changed a lot, whereas others have changed little. The predecessor pairs
of those that have changed a lot are more likely to also change a lot. In a
stochastic environment, variations in estimated transition probabilities also
contribute to variations in the sizes of changes and in the urgency with which
pairs need to be backed up. It is natural to prioritize the backups according to
a measure of their urgency, and perform them in order of priority. This is the
idea behind prioritized sweeping. A queue is maintained of every state–action
pair whose estimated value would change nontrivially if backed up, prioritized
by the size of the change. When the top pair in the queue is backed up, the
eﬀect on each of its predecessor pairs is computed.
If the eﬀect is greater
than some small threshold, then the pair is inserted in the queue with the new
priority (if there is a previous entry of the pair in the queue, then insertion re-
sults in only the higher priority entry remaining in the queue). In this way the
eﬀects of changes are eﬃciently propagated backward until quiescence. The
full algorithm for the case of deterministic environments is given in Figure 8.9.

Example 8.4: Prioritized Sweeping on Mazes
Prioritized sweeping
has been found to dramatically increase the speed at which optimal solutions
are found in maze tasks, often by a factor of 5 to 10. A typical example is
shown in Figure 8.10. These data are for a sequence of maze tasks of exactly
the same structure as the one shown in Figure 8.5, except that they vary
in the grid resolution. Prioritized sweeping maintained a decisive advantage
over unprioritized Dyna-Q. Both systems made at most n = 5 backups per
environmental interaction.

Example 8.5: Rod Maneuvering The objective in this task is to maneuver
a rod around some awkwardly placed obstacles to a goal position in the fewest
number of steps (Figure 8.11). The rod can be translated along its long axis
or perpendicular to that axis, or it can be rotated in either direction around
its center. The distance of each movement is approximately 1/20 of the work
space, and the rotation increment is 10 degrees. Translations are deterministic
and quantized to one of 20
20 positions. The ﬁgure shows the obstacles and
the shortest solution from start to goal, found by prioritized sweeping. This
problem is still deterministic, but has four actions and 14,400 potential states
(some of these are unreachable because of the obstacles). This problem is

probably too large to be solved with unprioritized methods.

Prioritized sweeping is clearly a powerful idea, but the algorithms that have
been developed so far appear not to extend easily to more interesting cases.
The greatest problem is that the algorithms appear to rely on the assumption
of discrete states. When a change occurs at one state, these methods perform
a computation on all the predecessor states that may have been aﬀected. If
function approximation is used to learn the model or the value function, then
a single backup could inﬂuence a great many other states. It is not apparent
how these states could be identiﬁed or processed eﬃciently. On the other hand,
the general idea of focusing search on the states believed to have changed in
value, and then on their predecessors, seems intuitively to be valid in general.
Additional research may produce more general versions of prioritized sweeping.

Extensions of prioritized sweeping to stochastic environments are relatively
straightforward. The model is maintained by keeping counts of the number of
times each state–action pair has been experienced and of what the next states
were. It is natural then to backup each pair not with a sample backup, as we
have been using so far, but with a full backup, taking into account all possible
next states and their probabilities of occurring.

8.5 Full vs. Sample Backups

The examples in the previous sections give some idea of the range of possi-
bilities for combining methods of learning and planning. In the rest of this
chapter, we analyze some of the component ideas involved, starting with the
relative advantages of full and sample backups.

Much of this book has been about diﬀerent kinds of backups, and we have
considered a great many varieties. Focusing for the moment on one-step back-
ups, they vary primarily along three binary dimensions. The ﬁrst two dimen-
sions are whether they back up state values or action values and whether they
estimate the value for the optimal policy or for an arbitrary given policy. These
two dimensions give rise to four classes of backups for approximating the four
value functions, q
, qπ, and vπ. The other binary dimension is whether the
backups are full backups, considering all possible events that might happen,
or sample backups, considering a single sample of what might happen. These
three binary dimensions give rise to eight cases, seven of which correspond to
speciﬁc algorithms, as shown in Figure 8.12. (The eighth case does not seem
to correspond to any useful backup.) Any of these one-step backups can be
used in planning methods. The Dyna-Q agents discussed earlier use q
sample
backups, but they could just as well use q
full backups, or either full or sam-
ple qπ backups. The Dyna-AC system uses vπ sample backups together with
a learning policy structure. For stochastic problems, prioritized sweeping is
always done using one of the full backups.

∗

∗

When we introduced one-step sample backups in Chapter 6, we presented
them as substitutes for full backups. In the absence of a distribution model,
full backups are not possible, but sample backups can be done using sample
transitions from the environment or a sample model. Implicit in that point
of view is that full backups, if possible, are preferable to sample backups.
But are they? Full backups certainly yield a better estimate because they are
uncorrupted by sampling error, but they also require more computation, and
computation is often the limiting resource in planning. To properly assess the
relative merits of full and sample backups for planning we must control for
their diﬀerent computational requirements.

For concreteness, consider the full and sample backups for approximating
q
, and the special case of discrete states and actions, a table-lookup repre-

sentation of the approximate value function, Q, and a model in the form of
estimated dynamics, ˆp(s(cid:48), r

The diﬀerence between these full and sample backups is signiﬁcant to the
extent that the environment is stochastic, speciﬁcally, to the extent that, given
a state and action, many possible next states may occur with various probabil-
ities. If only one next state is possible, then the full and sample backups given
above are identical (taking α = 1). If there are many possible next states, then
there may be signiﬁcant diﬀerences. In favor of the full backup is that it is an
exact computation, resulting in a new Q(s, a) whose correctness is limited only
by the correctness of the Q(s(cid:48), a(cid:48)) at successor states. The sample backup is
in addition aﬀected by sampling error. On the other hand, the sample backup
is cheaper computationally because it considers only one next state, not all
possible next states. In practice, the computation required by backup oper-
ations is usually dominated by the number of state–action pairs at which Q
is evaluated. For a particular starting pair, s, a, let b be the branching factor
(i.e., the number of possible next states, s(cid:48), for which ˆp(s(cid:48)
s, a) > 0). Then
|
a full backup of this pair requires roughly b times as much computation as a
sample backup.

If there is enough time to complete a full backup, then the resulting esti-
mate is generally better than that of b sample backups because of the absence
of sampling error. But if there is insuﬃcient time to complete a full backup,
then sample backups are always preferable because they at least make some
improvement in the value estimate with fewer than b backups. In a large prob-
lem with many state–action pairs, we are often in the latter situation. With
so many state–action pairs, full backups of all of them would take a very long
time. Before that we may be much better oﬀ with a few sample backups at
many state–action pairs than with full backups at a few pairs. Given a unit
of computational eﬀort, is it better devoted to a few full backups or to b times
as many sample backups?

Figure 8.13 shows the results of an analysis that suggests an answer to
this question.
It shows the estimation error as a function of computation
time for full and sample backups for a variety of branching factors, b. The
case considered is that in which all b successor states are equally likely and
in which the error in the initial estimate is 1. The values at the next states
are assumed correct, so the full backup reduces the error to zero upon its
1
completion. In this case, sample backups reduce the error according to

sample averages, i.e., α = 1/t). The key observation is that for moderately
large b the error falls dramatically with a tiny fraction of b backups. For these
cases, many state–action pairs could have their values improved dramatically,
to within a few percent of the eﬀect of a full backup, in the same time that
one state–action pair could be backed up fully.

The advantage of sample backups shown in Figure 8.13 is probably an
underestimate of the real eﬀect. In a real problem, the values of the succes-
sor states would themselves be estimates updated by backups. By causing
estimates to be more accurate sooner, sample backups will have a second ad-
vantage in that the values backed up from the successor states will be more
accurate. These results suggest that sample backups are likely to be superior
to full backups on problems with large stochastic branching factors and too
many states to be solved exactly.

8.6 Trajectory Sampling

In this section we compare two ways of distributing backups. The classical
approach, from dynamic programming, is to perform sweeps through the entire
state (or state–action) space, backing up each state (or state–action pair) once
per sweep. This is problematic on large tasks because there may not be time
to complete even one sweep. In many tasks the vast majority of the states are
irrelevant because they are visited only under very poor policies or with very
low probability. Exhaustive sweeps implicitly devote equal time to all parts

of the state space rather than focusing where it is needed. As we discussed in
Chapter 4, exhaustive sweeps and the equal treatment of all states that they
imply are not necessary properties of dynamic programming.
In principle,
backups can be distributed any way one likes (to assure convergence, all states
or state–action pairs must be visited in the limit an inﬁnite number of times),
but in practice exhaustive sweeps are often used.

The second approach is to sample from the state or state–action space ac-
cording to some distribution. One could sample uniformly, as in the Dyna-Q
agent, but this would suﬀer from some of the same problems as exhaustive
sweeps. More appealing is to distribute backups according to the on-policy
distribution, that is, according to the distribution observed when following the
current policy. One advantage of this distribution is that it is easily gener-
ated; one simply interacts with the model, following the current policy. In an
episodic task, one starts in the start state (or according to the starting-state
distribution) and simulates until the terminal state. In a continuing task, one
starts anywhere and just keeps simulating. In either case, sample state tran-
sitions and rewards are given by the model, and sample actions are given by
the current policy. In other words, one simulates explicit individual trajecto-
ries and performs backups at the state or state–action pairs encountered along
the way. We call this way of generating experience and backups trajectory
sampling.

It is hard to imagine any eﬃcient way of distributing backups according
to the on-policy distribution other than by trajectory sampling. If one had
an explicit representation of the on-policy distribution, then one could sweep
through all states, weighting the backup of each according to the on-policy dis-
tribution, but this leaves us again with all the computational costs of exhaus-
tive sweeps. Possibly one could sample and update individual state–action
pairs from the distribution, but even if this could be done eﬃciently, what
beneﬁt would this provide over simulating trajectories? Even knowing the
on-policy distribution in an explicit form is unlikely. The distribution changes
whenever the policy changes, and computing the distribution requires com-
putation comparable to a complete policy evaluation. Consideration of such
other possibilities makes trajectory sampling seem both eﬃcient and elegant.

Is the on-policy distribution of backups a good one? Intuitively it seems
like a good choice, at least better than the uniform distribution. For example,
if you are learning to play chess, you study positions that might arise in real
games, not random positions of chess pieces. The latter may be valid states,
but to be able to accurately value them is a diﬀerent skill from evaluating
positions in real games. We will also see in Chapter 9 that the on-policy
distribution has signiﬁcant advantages when function approximation is used.
Whether or not function approximation is used, one might expect on-policy

8.6. TRAJECTORY SAMPLING

215

focusing to signiﬁcantly improve the speed of planning.

Focusing on the on-policy distribution could be beneﬁcial because it causes
vast, uninteresting parts of the space to be ignored, or it could be detrimental
because it causes the same old parts of the space to be backed up over and
over. We conducted a small experiment to assess the eﬀect empirically. To
isolate the eﬀect of the backup distribution, we used entirely one-step full
tabular backups, as deﬁned by (8.1). In the uniform case, we cycled through
all state–action pairs, backing up each in place, and in the on-policy case we
simulated episodes, backing up each state–action pair that occurred under
the current (cid:15)-greedy policy ((cid:15) = 0.1). The tasks were undiscounted episodic
tasks, generated randomly as follows. From each of the
states, two actions
were possible, each of which resulted in one of b next states, all equally likely,
with a diﬀerent random selection of b states for each state–action pair. The
branching factor, b, was the same for all state–action pairs. In addition, on
all transitions there was a 0.1 probability of transition to the terminal state,
ending the episode. We used episodic tasks to get a clear measure of the quality
of the current policy. At any point in the planning process one can stop and
exhaustively compute v˜π(s0), the true value of the start state under the greedy
policy, ˜π, given the current action-value function Q, as an indication of how
well the agent would do on a new episode on which it acted greedily (all the
while assuming the model is correct).

|

The upper part of Figure 8.14 shows results averaged over 200 sample
tasks with 1000 states and branching factors of 1, 3, and 10. The quality
of the policies found is plotted as a function of the number of full backups
completed. In all cases, sampling according to the on-policy distribution re-
sulted in faster planning initially and retarded planning in the long run. The
eﬀect was stronger, and the initial period of faster planning was longer, at
smaller branching factors. In other experiments, we found that these eﬀects
also became stronger as the number of states increased. For example, the
lower part of Figure 8.14 shows results for a branching factor of 1 for tasks
with 10,000 states. In this case the advantage of on-policy focusing is large
and long-lasting.

All of these results make sense. In the short term, sampling according to the
on-policy distribution helps by focusing on states that are near descendants

this eﬀect will be large and long-lasting.
In the long run, focusing on the
on-policy distribution may hurt because the commonly occurring states all
already have their correct values. Sampling them is useless, whereas sampling
other states may actually perform some useful work. This presumably is why
the exhaustive, unfocused approach does better in the long run, at least for
small problems. These results are not conclusive because they are only for

problems generated in a particular, random way, but they do suggest that
sampling according to the on-policy distribution can be a great advantage
for large problems, in particular for problems in which a small subset of the
state–action space is visited under the on-policy distribution.

8.7 Heuristic Search

The predominant state-space planning methods in artiﬁcial intelligence are
collectively known as heuristic search. Although superﬁcially diﬀerent from
the planning methods we have discussed so far in this chapter, heuristic search
and some of its component ideas can be combined with these methods in
useful ways. Unlike these methods, heuristic search is not concerned with
changing the approximate, or “heuristic,” value function, but only with making
improved action selections given the current value function. In other words,
heuristic search is planning as part of a policy computation.

In heuristic search, for each state encountered, a large tree of possible
continuations is considered. The approximate value function is applied to the
leaf nodes and then backed up toward the current state at the root. The
backing up within the search tree is just the same as in the max-backups
(those for v
) discussed throughout this book. The backing up stops
∗
at the state–action nodes for the current state. Once the backed-up values of
these nodes are computed, the best of them is chosen as the current action,
and then all backed-up values are discarded.

and q

∗

In conventional heuristic search no eﬀort is made to save the backed-up
values by changing the approximate value function. In fact, the value func-
tion is generally designed by people and never changed as a result of search.
However, it is natural to consider allowing the value function to be improved
over time, using either the backed-up values computed during heuristic search
or any of the other methods presented throughout this book. In a sense we
have taken this approach all along. Our greedy and ε-greedy action-selection
methods are not unlike heuristic search, albeit on a smaller scale. For exam-
ple, to compute the greedy action given a model and a state-value function, we
must look ahead from each possible action to each possible next state, backup
the rewards and estimated values, and then pick the best action. Just as in
conventional heuristic search, this process computes backed-up values of the
possible actions, but does not attempt to save them. Thus, heuristic search
can be viewed as an extension of the idea of a greedy policy beyond a single
step.

The point of searching deeper than one step is to obtain better action

218CHAPTER 8. PLANNING AND LEARNING WITH TABULAR METHODS

selections. If one has a perfect model and an imperfect action-value function,
then in fact deeper search will usually yield better policies.2 Certainly, if the
search is all the way to the end of the episode, then the eﬀect of the imperfect
value function is eliminated, and the action determined in this way must be
optimal. If the search is of suﬃcient depth k such that γk is very small, then the
actions will be correspondingly near optimal. On the other hand, the deeper
the search, the more computation is required, usually resulting in a slower
response time. A good example is provided by Tesauro’s grandmaster-level
backgammon player, TD-Gammon (Section 15.1). This system used TD(λ)
to learn an afterstate value function through many games of self-play, using a
form of heuristic search to make its moves. As a model, TD-Gammon used a
priori knowledge of the probabilities of dice rolls and the assumption that the
opponent always selected the actions that TD-Gammon rated as best for it.
Tesauro found that the deeper the heuristic search, the better the moves made
by TD-Gammon, but the longer it took to make each move. Backgammon
has a large branching factor, yet moves must be made within a few seconds.
It was only feasible to search ahead selectively a few steps, but even so the
search resulted in signiﬁcantly better action selections.

So far we have emphasized heuristic search as an action-selection technique,
but this may not be its most important aspect. Heuristic search also suggests
ways of selectively distributing backups that may lead to better and faster
approximation of the optimal value function. A great deal of research on
heuristic search has been devoted to making the search as eﬃcient as possible.
The search tree is grown selectively, deeper along some lines and shallower
along others. For example, the search tree is often deeper for the actions
that seem most likely to be best, and shallower for those that the agent will
probably not want to take anyway. Can we use a similar idea to improve the
distribution of backups? Perhaps it can be done by preferentially updating
state–action pairs whose values appear to be close to the maximum available
from the state. To our knowledge, this and other possibilities for distributing
backups based on ideas borrowed from heuristic search have not yet been
explored.

We should not overlook the most obvious way in which heuristic search
focuses backups: on the current state. Much of the eﬀectiveness of heuristic
search is due to its search tree being tightly focused on the states and actions
that might immediately follow the current state. You may spend more of
your life playing chess than checkers, but when you play checkers, it pays to
think about checkers and about your particular checkers position, your likely
next moves, and successor positions. However you select actions, it is these
states and actions that are of highest priority for backups and where you

sequence of one-step backups (shown here outlined). The ordering shown is
for a selective depth-ﬁrst search.

most urgently want your approximate value function to be accurate. Not only
should your computation be preferentially devoted to imminent events, but so
should your limited memory resources. In chess, for example, there are far too
many possible positions to store distinct value estimates for each of them, but
chess programs based on heuristic search can easily store distinct estimates for
the millions of positions they encounter looking ahead from a single position.
This great focusing of memory and computational resources on the current
decision is presumably the reason why heuristic search can be so eﬀective.

The distribution of backups can be altered in similar ways to focus on the
current state and its likely successors. As a limiting case we might use exactly
the methods of heuristic search to construct a search tree, and then perform the
individual, one-step backups from bottom up, as suggested by Figure 8.15. If
the backups are ordered in this way and a table-lookup representation is used,
then exactly the same backup would be achieved as in heuristic search. Any
state-space search can be viewed in this way as the piecing together of a large
number of individual one-step backups. Thus, the performance improvement
observed with deeper searches is not due to the use of multistep backups as
such. Instead, it is due to the focus and concentration of backups on states
and actions immediately downstream from the current state. By devoting a
large amount of computation speciﬁcally relevant to the candidate actions, a
much better decision can be made than by relying on unfocused backups.

8.8 Monte Carlo Tree Search

8.9 Summary

We have presented a perspective emphasizing the surprisingly close relation-
ships between planning optimal behavior and learning optimal behavior. Both
involve estimating the same value functions, and in both cases it is natural
to update the estimates incrementally, in a long series of small backup op-
erations. This makes it straightforward to integrate learning and planning
processes simply by allowing both to update the same estimated value func-
tion. In addition, any of the learning methods can be converted into planning
methods simply by applying them to simulated (model-generated) experience
rather than to real experience. In this case learning and planning become even
more similar; they are possibly identical algorithms operating on two diﬀerent
sources of experience.

It is straightforward to integrate incremental planning methods with acting
and model-learning. Planning, acting, and model-learning interact in a circular
fashion (Figure 8.2), each producing what the other needs to improve; no other
interaction among them is either required or prohibited. The most natural
approach is for all processes to proceed asynchronously and in parallel.
If
the processes must share computational resources, then the division can be
handled almost arbitrarily—by whatever organization is most convenient and
eﬃcient for the task at hand.

In this chapter we have touched upon a number of dimensions of variation
among state-space planning methods. One of the most important of these is
the distribution of backups, that is, of the focus of search. Prioritized sweep-
ing focuses on the predecessors of states whose values have recently changed.
Heuristic search applied to reinforcement learning focuses, inter alia, on the
successors of the current state. Trajectory sampling is a convenient way of fo-
cusing on the on-policy distribution. All of these approaches can signiﬁcantly
speed planning and are current topics of research.

Another interesting dimension of variation is the size of backups. The
smaller the backups, the more incremental the planning methods can be.
Among the smallest backups are one-step sample backups. We presented one
study suggesting that one-step sample backups may be preferable on very large
problems. A related issue is the depth of backups. In many cases deep backups
can be implemented as sequences of shallow backups.

8.9. SUMMARY

221

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

8.1

The overall view of planning and learning presented here has devel-
oped gradually over a number of years, in part by the authors (Sutton,
1990, 1991a, 1991b; Barto, Bradtke, and Singh, 1991, 1995; Sutton and
Pinette, 1985; Sutton and Barto, 1981b); it has been strongly inﬂu-
enced by Agre and Chapman (1990; Agre 1988), Bertsekas and Tsit-
siklis (1989), Singh (1993), and others. The authors were also strongly
inﬂuenced by psychological studies of latent learning (Tolman, 1932)
and by psychological views of the nature of thought (e.g., Galanter and
Gerstenhaber, 1956; Craik, 1943; Campbell, 1960; Dennett, 1978).

8.2–3 The terms direct and indirect, which we use to describe diﬀerent kinds
of reinforcement learning, are from the adaptive control literature (e.g.,
Goodwin and Sin, 1984), where they are used to make the same kind of
distinction. The term system identiﬁcation is used in adaptive control
for what we call model-learning (e.g., Goodwin and Sin, 1984; Ljung
and S¨oderstrom, 1983; Young, 1984). The Dyna architecture is due to
Sutton (1990), and the results in these sections are based on results
reported there.

Exercises

Exercise 8.1 There is no Exercise 8.1.

Exercise 8.2 Why did the Dyna agent with exploration bonus, Dyna-Q+,
perform better in the ﬁrst phase as well as in the second phase of the blocking
and shortcut experiments?

222CHAPTER 8. PLANNING AND LEARNING WITH TABULAR METHODS

Exercise 8.3 Careful inspection of Figure 8.8 reveals that the diﬀerence
between Dyna-Q+ and Dyna-Q narrowed slightly over the ﬁrst part of the
experiment. What is the reason for this?

Exercise 8.4 (programming) The exploration bonus described above ac-
tually changes the estimated values of states and actions. Is this necessary?
Suppose the bonus κ√τ was used not in backups, but solely in action selection.
That is, suppose the action selected was always that for which Q(S, a)+κ√τSa
was maximal. Carry out a gridworld experiment that tests and illustrates the
strengths and weaknesses of this alternate approach.

Exercise 8.5 The analysis above assumed that all of the b possible next
states were equally likely to occur. Suppose instead that the distribution was
highly skewed, that some of the b states were much more likely to occur than
most. Would this strengthen or weaken the case for sample backups over full
backups? Support your answer.

Exercise 8.6 Some of the graphs in Figure 8.14 seem to be scalloped in
their early portions, particularly the upper graph for b = 1 and the uniform
distribution. Why do you think this is? What aspects of the data shown
support your hypothesis?

Exercise 8.7 (programming)
If you have access to a moderately large
computer, try replicating the experiment whose results are shown in the lower

On-policy Approximation of
Action Values

We have so far assumed that our estimates of value functions are represented
as a table with one entry for each state or for each state–action pair. This is
a particularly clear and instructive case, but of course it is limited to tasks
with small numbers of states and actions. The problem is not just the memory
needed for large tables, but the time and data needed to ﬁll them accurately.
In other words, the key issue is that of generalization. How can experience
with a limited subset of the state space be usefully generalized to produce a
good approximation over a much larger subset?

This is a severe problem. In many tasks to which we would like to apply
reinforcement learning, most states encountered will never have been expe-
rienced exactly before. This will almost always be the case when the state
or action spaces include continuous variables or complex sensations, such as
a visual image. The only way to learn anything at all on these tasks is to
generalize from previously experienced states to ones that have never been
seen.

Fortunately, generalization from examples has already been extensively
studied, and we do not need to invent totally new methods for use in reinforce-
ment learning. To a large extent we need only combine reinforcement learning
methods with existing generalization methods. The kind of generalization we
require is often called function approximation because it takes examples from a
desired function (e.g., a value function) and attempts to generalize from them
to construct an approximation of the entire function. Function approximation
is an instance of supervised learning, the primary topic studied in machine
learning, artiﬁcial neural networks, pattern recognition, and statistical curve
ﬁtting. In principle, any of the methods studied in these ﬁelds can be used in

reinforcement learning as described in this chapter.

9.1 Value Prediction with Function Approxi-

mation

≈

As usual, we begin with the prediction problem of estimating the state-value
function vπ from experience generated using policy π. The novelty in this
chapter is that the approximate value function is represented not as a table
Rn. We
but as a parameterized functional form with parameter vector w
vπ(s) for the approximated value of state s given weight
will write ˆv(s,w)
vector w. For example, ˆv might be the function computed by an artiﬁcial
neural network, with w the vector of connection weights. By adjusting the
weights, any of a wide range of diﬀerent functions ˆv can be implemented by
the network. Or ˆv might be the function computed by a decision tree, where
w is all the parameters deﬁning the split points and leaf values of the tree.
Typically, the number of parameters n (the number of components of w) is
much less than the number of states, and changing one parameter changes the
estimated value of many states. Consequently, when a single state is backed
up, the change generalizes from that state to aﬀect the values of many other
states.

∈

All of the prediction methods covered in this book have been described
as backups, that is, as updates to an estimated value function that shift its
value at particular states toward a “backed-up value” for that state. Let us
refer to an individual backup by the notation s
v, where s is the state
backed up and v is the backed-up value, or target, that s’s estimated value
is shifted toward. For example, the Monte Carlo backup for value predic-

(cid:55)→

It is natural to interpret each backup as specifying an example of the
desired input–output behavior of the estimated value function. In a sense, the
backup s
v means that the estimated value for state s should be more like
v. Up to now, the actual update implementing the backup has been trivial:
the table entry for s’s estimated value has simply been shifted a fraction of the
way toward v. Now we permit arbitrarily complex and sophisticated function
approximation methods to implement the backup. The normal inputs to these
methods are examples of the desired input–output behavior of the function

9.1. VALUE PREDICTION WITH FUNCTION APPROXIMATION 227

they are trying to approximate. We use these methods for value prediction
v of each backup as a training example. We
simply by passing to them the s
then interpret the approximate function they produce as an estimated value
function.

(cid:55)→

Viewing each backup as a conventional training example in this way enables
us to use any of a wide range of existing function approximation methods for
value prediction. In principle, we can use any method for supervised learning
from examples, including artiﬁcial neural networks, decision trees, and vari-
ous kinds of multivariate regression. However, not all function approximation
methods are equally well suited for use in reinforcement learning. The most so-
phisticated neural network and statistical methods all assume a static training
set over which multiple passes are made. In reinforcement learning, however,
it is important that learning be able to occur on-line, while interacting with
the environment or with a model of the environment. To do this requires
methods that are able to learn eﬃciently from incrementally acquired data.
In addition, reinforcement learning generally requires function approximation
methods able to handle nonstationary target functions (target functions that
change over time). For example, in GPI control methods we often seek to
learn qπ while π changes. Even if the policy remains the same, the target
values of training examples are nonstationary if they are generated by boot-
strapping methods (DP and TD). Methods that cannot easily handle such
nonstationarity are less suitable for reinforcement learning.

What performance measures are appropriate for evaluating function ap-
proximation methods? Most supervised learning methods seek to minimize
the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over some distribution over the inputs.
In our value prediction problem, the inputs are states and the target function is
the true value function vπ, so RMSE for an approximation ˆv, using parameter
w, is

RMSE(w) =

where d : S
s d(s) = 1, is a distribution over the states
specifying the relative importance of errors in diﬀerent states. This distri-
bution is important because it is usually not possible to reduce the error to
zero at all states. After all, there are generally far more states than there
are components to w. The ﬂexibility of the function approximator is thus a
scarce resource. Better approximation at some states can be gained, generally,
only at the expense of worse approximation at other states. The distribution
speciﬁes how these trade-oﬀs should be made.

(cid:80)

The distribution d is also usually the distribution from which the states in
the training examples are drawn, and thus the distribution of states at which

228CHAPTER 9. ON-POLICY APPROXIMATION OF ACTION VALUES

backups are done. If we wish to minimize error over a certain distribution of
states, then it makes sense to train the function approximator with examples
from that same distribution. For example, if you want a uniform level of error
over the entire state set, then it makes sense to train with backups distributed
uniformly over the entire state set, such as in the exhaustive sweeps of some
DP methods. Henceforth, let us assume that the distribution of states at which
backups are done and the distribution that weights errors, d, are the same.

A distribution of particular interest is the one describing the frequency with
which states are encountered while the agent is interacting with the environ-
ment and selecting actions according to π, the policy whose value function we
are approximating. We call this the on-policy distribution, in part because it
is the distribution of backups in on-policy control methods. Minimizing error
over the on-policy distribution focuses function approximation resources on
the states that actually occur while following the policy, ignoring those that
never occur. The on-policy distribution is also the one for which it is easiest to
get training examples using Monte Carlo or TD methods. These methods gen-
erate backups from sample experience using the policy π. Because a backup
is generated for each state encountered in the experience, the training exam-
ples available are naturally distributed according to the on-policy distribution.
Stronger convergence results are available for the on-policy distribution than
for other distributions, as we discuss later.

It is not completely clear that we should care about minimizing the RMSE.
Our goal in value prediction is potentially diﬀerent because our ultimate pur-
pose is to use the predictions to aid in ﬁnding a better policy. The best pre-
dictions for that purpose are not necessarily the best for minimizing RMSE.
However, it is not yet clear what a more useful alternative goal for value pre-
diction might be. For now, we continue to focus on RMSE.

≤

An ideal goal in terms of RMSE would be to ﬁnd a global optimum, a
RMSE(w) for all possible w.
parameter vector w∗ for which RMSE(w∗)
Reaching this goal is sometimes possible for simple function approximators
such as linear ones, but is rarely possible for complex function approximators
such as artiﬁcial neural networks and decision trees. Short of this, complex
function approximators may seek to converge instead to a local optimum, a
parameter vector w∗ for which RMSE(w∗)
RMSE(w) for all w in some
neighborhood of w∗. Although this guarantee is only slightly reassuring, it is
typically the best that can be said for nonlinear function approximators. For
many cases of interest in reinforcement learning, convergence to an optimum,
or even all bound of an optimum may still be achieved with some methods.
Other methods may in fact diverge, with their RMSE approaching inﬁnity in
the limit.

9.2. GRADIENT-DESCENT METHODS

229

In this section we have outlined a framework for combining a wide range
of reinforcement learning methods for value prediction with a wide range of
function approximation methods, using the backups of the former to generate
training examples for the latter. We have also outlined a range of RMSE per-
formance measures to which these methods may aspire. The range of possible
methods is far too large to cover all, and anyway too little is known about
most of them to make a reliable evaluation or recommendation. Of necessity,
we consider only a few possibilities. In the rest of this chapter we focus on
function approximation methods based on gradient principles, and on linear
gradient-descent methods in particular. We focus on these methods in part
because we consider them to be particularly promising and because they re-
veal key theoretical issues, but also because they are simple and our space
is limited. If we had another chapter devoted to function approximation, we
would also cover at least memory-based and decision-tree methods.

9.2 Gradient-Descent Methods

We now develop in detail one class of learning methods for function approxi-
mation in value prediction, those based on gradient descent. Gradient-descent
methods are among the most widely used of all function approximation meth-
ods and are particularly well suited to online reinforcement learning.

In gradient-descent methods, the parameter vector is a column vector with
a ﬁxed number of real valued components, w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn)(cid:62) (the (cid:62) here
denotes transpose), and the approximate value function ˆv(s,w) is a smooth
S. We will be updating w at each of
diﬀerentiable function of w for all s
∈
a series of discrete time steps, t = 1, 2, 3, . . ., so we will need a notation wt
for the weight vector at each step. For now, let us assume that, on each step,
vπ(St) consisting of a (possibly randomly
we observe a new example St (cid:55)→
selected) state St and its true value under the policy. These states might be
successive states from an interaction with the environment, but for now we do
not assume so. Even though we are given the exact, correct values, vπ(St) for
each St, there is still a diﬃcult problem because our function approximator has
limited resources and thus limited resolution. In particular, there is generally
no w that gets all the states, or even all the examples, exactly correct. In
addition, we must generalize to all the other states that have not appeared in
examples.

We assume that states appear in examples with the same distribution, d,
over which we are trying to minimize the RMSE as given by (9.1). A good
strategy in this case is to try to minimize error on the observed examples.
Gradient-descent methods do this by adjusting the parameter vector after

230CHAPTER 9. ON-POLICY APPROXIMATION OF ACTION VALUES

each example by a small amount in the direction that would most reduce the
error on that example:

where α is a positive step-size parameter, and
f (wt), for any expression
f (wt), denotes the vector of partial derivatives with respect to the components
of the weight vector:

(cid:62)

∂f (wt)
∂wt,n (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

This derivative vector is the gradient of f with respect to wt. This kind of
method is called gradient descent because the overall step in wt is proportional
to the negative gradient of the example’s squared error. This is the direction
in which the error falls most rapidly.

It may not be immediately apparent why only a small step is taken in the
direction of the gradient. Could we not move all the way in this direction
and completely eliminate the error on the example? In many cases this could
be done, but usually it is not desirable. Remember that we do not seek or
expect to ﬁnd a value function that has zero error on all states, but only an
approximation that balances the errors in diﬀerent states. If we completely
corrected each example in one step, then we would not ﬁnd such a balance. In
fact, the convergence results for gradient methods assume that the step-size
parameter decreases over time. If it decreases in such a way as to satisfy the
standard stochastic approximation conditions (2.7), then the gradient-descent
method (9.2) is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum.

We turn now to the case in which the target output, Vt, of the tth training
Vt, is not the true value, vπ(St), but some, possibly random,
example, St (cid:55)→
approximation of it. For example, Vt might be a noise-corrupted version of
vπ(St), or it might be one of the backed-up values using ˆv mentioned in the
previous section.
In such cases we cannot perform the exact update (9.2)
because vπ(St) is unknown, but we can approximate it by substituting Vt in
place of vπ(St). This yields the general gradient-descent method for state-value
prediction:

wt+1 = wt + α

Vt −

ˆv(St,wt)

∇
(cid:105)

(cid:104)

If Vt is an unbiased estimate, that is, if E[Vt] = vπ(St), for each t, then wt is
guaranteed to converge to a local optimum under the usual stochastic approx-
imation conditions (2.7) for decreasing the step-size parameter α.

ˆv(St,wt).

(9.3)

9.2. GRADIENT-DESCENT METHODS

231

For example, suppose the states in the examples are the states generated
by interaction (or simulated interaction) with the environment using policy
π. Let Gt denote the return following each state, St. Because the true value
of a state is the expected value of the return following it, the Monte Carlo
target Vt = Gt is by deﬁnition an unbiased estimate of vπ(St). With this
choice, the general gradient-descent method (9.3) converges to a locally op-
timal approximation to vπ(St). Thus, the gradient-descent version of Monte
Carlo state-value prediction is guaranteed to ﬁnd a locally optimal solution.

Similarly, we can use n-step TD returns and their averages for Vt. For
t , as

example, the gradient-descent form of TD(λ) uses the λ-return, Vt = Gλ
its approximation to vπ(St), yielding the forward-view update:

Gλ

t −

∇
(cid:105)

wt+1 = wt + α

ˆv(St,wt)

ˆv(St,wt).

(9.4)

Unfortunately, for λ < 1, Gλ
is not an unbiased estimate of vπ(St), and thus
t
this method does not converge to a local optimum. The situation is the same
when DP targets are used such as Vt = Eπ[Rt+1 + γˆv(St+1,wt)
St]. Never-
theless, such bootstrapping methods can be quite eﬀective, and other perfor-
mance guarantees are available for important special cases, as we discuss later
in this chapter. For now we emphasize the relationship of these methods to
the general gradient-descent form (9.3). Although increments as in (9.4) are
not themselves gradients, it is useful to view this method as a gradient-descent
method (9.3) with a bootstrapping approximation in place of the desired out-
put, vπ(St).

As (9.4) provides the forward view of gradient-descent TD(λ), so the back-

ward view is provided by

wt+1 = wt + αδt et,

where δt is the usual TD error, now using ˆv,

with e0 = 0. A complete algorithm for on-line gradient-descent TD(λ) is given
in Figure 9.1.

Two methods for gradient-based function approximation have been used
widely in reinforcement learning. One is multilayer artiﬁcial neural networks
using the error backpropagation algorithm. This maps immediately onto the
equations and algorithms just given, where the backpropagation process is the
way of computing the gradients. The second popular form is the linear form,
which we discuss extensively in the next section.

9.3 Linear Methods

One of the most important special cases of gradient-descent function approxi-
mation is that in which the approximate function, ˆv, is a linear function of the
parameter vector, w. Corresponding to every state s, there is a vector of fea-
tures x(s) = (x1(s), x2(s), . . . , xn(s))(cid:62), with the same number of components
as w. The features may be constructed from the states in many diﬀerent ways;
we cover a few possibilities below. However the features are constructed, the
approximate state-value function is given by

ˆv(s,w) = w(cid:62)x(s) =

wixi(s).

n

i=1
(cid:88)

(9.8)

In this case the approximate value function is said to be linear in the param-
eters, or simply linear.

It is natural to use gradient-descent updates with linear function approxi-
mation. The gradient of the approximate value function with respect to w in
this case is

ˆv(s,w) = x(s).

∇

Thus, the general gradient-descent update (9.3) reduces to a particularly sim-
ple form in the linear case. In addition, in the linear case there is only one
optimum w∗ (or, in degenerate cases, one set of equally good optima). Thus,
any method guaranteed to converge to or near a local optimum is automat-
ically guaranteed to converge to or near the global optimum. Because it is
simple in these ways, the linear, gradient-descent case is one of the most fa-
vorable for mathematical analysis. Almost all useful convergence results for

9.3. LINEAR METHODS

233

learning systems of all kinds are for linear (or simpler) function approximation
methods.

In particular, the gradient-descent TD(λ) algorithm discussed in the pre-
vious section (Figure 9.1) has been proved to converge in the linear case if
the step-size parameter is reduced over time according to the usual conditions
(2.7). Convergence is not to the minimum-error parameter vector, w∗, but to
a nearby parameter vector, w

error. As λ approaches 1, the bound approaches the minimum error. An anal-
ogous bound applies to other on-policy bootstrapping methods. For example,
linear gradient-descent DP backups (9.3), with the on-policy distribution, will
converge to the same result as TD(0). Technically, this bound applies only to
discounted continuing tasks, but a related result presumably holds for episodic
tasks. There are also a few technical conditions on the rewards, features, and
decrease in the step-size parameter, which we are omitting here. The full
details can be found in the original paper (Tsitsiklis and Van Roy, 1997).

Critical to the above result is that states are backed up according to the
on-policy distribution. For other backup distributions, bootstrapping methods
using function approximation may actually diverge to inﬁnity. Examples of
this and a discussion of possible solution methods are given in Chapter 10.

Beyond these theoretical results, linear learning methods are also of inter-
est because in practice they can be very eﬃcient in terms of both data and
computation. Whether or not this is so depends critically on how the states
are represented in terms of the features. Choosing features appropriate to the
task is an important way of adding prior domain knowledge to reinforcement
learning systems. Intuitively, the features should correspond to the natural
features of the task, those along which generalization is most appropriate. If
we are valuing geometric objects, for example, we might want to have features
for each possible shape, color, size, or function. If we are valuing states of a
mobile robot, then we might want to have features for locations, degrees of
remaining battery power, recent sonar readings, and so on.

In general, we also need features for combinations of these natural qualities.
This is because the linear form prohibits the representation of interactions
between features, such as the presence of feature i being good only in the
absence of feature j. For example, in the pole-balancing task (Example 3.4),
a high angular velocity may be either good or bad depending on the angular
position. If the angle is high, then high angular velocity means an imminent
danger of falling, a bad state, whereas if the angle is low, then high angular

on the number of their features whose receptive ﬁelds (in this case, circles)
overlap. These states have one feature in common, so there will be slight
generalization between them.

velocity means the pole is righting itself, a good state.
In cases with such
interactions one needs to introduce features for conjunctions of feature values
when using linear function approximation methods. We next consider some
general ways of doing this.

Coarse Coding

Consider a task in which the state set is continuous and two-dimensional. A
state in this case is a point in 2-space, a vector with two real components. One
kind of feature for this case is those corresponding to circles in state space,
as shown in Figure 9.2. If the state is inside a circle, then the corresponding
feature has the value 1 and is said to be present; otherwise the feature is 0 and
is said to be absent. This kind of 1–0-valued feature is called a binary feature.
Given a state, which binary features are present indicate within which circles
the state lies, and thus coarsely code for its location. Representing a state
with features that overlap in this way (although they need not be circles or
binary) is known as coarse coding.

Assuming linear gradient-descent function approximation, consider the ef-
fect of the size and density of the circles. Corresponding to each circle is a
single parameter (a component of w) that is aﬀected by learning. If we train
at one point (state) X, then the parameters of all circles intersecting X will be
aﬀected. Thus, by (9.8), the approximate value function will be aﬀected at all
points within the union of the circles, with a greater eﬀect the more circles a
point has “in common” with X, as shown in Figure 9.2. If the circles are small,
then the generalization will be over a short distance, as in Figure 9.3a, whereas

Figure 9.3: Generalization in linear function approximation methods is deter-
mined by the sizes and shapes of the features’ receptive ﬁelds. All three of
these cases have roughly the same number and density of features.

if they are large, it will be over a large distance, as in Figure 9.3b. Moreover,
the shape of the features will determine the nature of the generalization. For
example, if they are not strictly circular, but are elongated in one direction,
then generalization will be similarly aﬀected, as in Figure 9.3c.

Features with large receptive ﬁelds give broad generalization, but might
also seem to limit the learned function to a coarse approximation, unable
to make discriminations much ﬁner than the width of the receptive ﬁelds.
Happily, this is not the case. Initial generalization from one point to another
is indeed controlled by the size and shape of the receptive ﬁelds, but acuity,
the ﬁnest discrimination ultimately possible, is controlled more by the total
number of features.

Example 9.1: Coarseness of Coarse Coding This example illustrates
the eﬀect on learning of the size of the receptive ﬁelds in coarse coding. Linear
function approximation based on coarse coding and (9.3) was used to learn a
one-dimensional square-wave function (shown at the top of Figure 9.4). The
values of this function were used as the targets, Vt. With just one dimension,
the receptive ﬁelds were intervals rather than circles. Learning was repeated
with three diﬀerent sizes of the intervals: narrow, medium, and broad, as
shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure. All three cases had the same density of
features, about 50 over the extent of the function being learned. Training
examples were generated uniformly at random over this extent. The step-size
parameter was α = 0.2
m , where m is the number of features that were present
at one time. Figure 9.4 shows the functions learned in all three cases over the
course of learning. Note that the width of the features had a strong eﬀect early
in learning. With broad features, the generalization tended to be broad; with
narrow features, only the close neighbors of each trained point were changed,
causing the function learned to be more bumpy. However, the ﬁnal function

learned was aﬀected only slightly by the width of the features. Receptive
ﬁeld shape tends to have a strong eﬀect on generalization but little eﬀect on
asymptotic solution quality.

Tile Coding

Tile coding is a form of coarse coding that is particularly well suited for use on
sequential digital computers and for eﬃcient on-line learning. In tile coding
the receptive ﬁelds of the features are grouped into exhaustive partitions of
the input space. Each such partition is called a tiling, and each element of the
partition is called a tile. Each tile is the receptive ﬁeld for one binary feature.

An immediate advantage of tile coding is that the overall number of features
that are present at one time is strictly controlled and independent of the input
state. Exactly one feature is present in each tiling, so the total number of
features present is always the same as the number of tilings. This allows
the step-size parameter, α, to be set in an easy, intuitive way. For example,
choosing α = 1
m , where m is the number of tilings, results in exact one-trial
v is received, then whatever the prior value,
learning.
ˆv(s,w), the new value will be ˆv(s,w) = v. Usually one wishes to change more
slowly than this, to allow for generalization and stochastic variation in target
outputs. For example, one might choose α = 1
10m , in which case one would
move one-tenth of the way to the target in one update.

If the example s

sum making up the approximate value function (9.8) is almost trivial to com-
pute. Rather than performing n multiplications and additions, one simply
computes the indices of the m
n present features and then adds up the
m corresponding components of the parameter vector. The eligibility trace
computation (9.7) is also simpliﬁed because the components of the gradient,

(cid:28)

ˆv(s,w), are also usually 0, and otherwise 1.

∇

The computation of the indices of the present features is particularly easy
if gridlike tilings are used. The ideas and techniques here are best illustrated
by examples. Suppose we address a task with two continuous state variables.
Then the simplest way to tile the space is with a uniform two-dimensional
grid:

Given the x and y coordinates of a point in the space, it is computationally
easy to determine the index of the tile it is in. When multiple tilings are used,
each is oﬀset by a diﬀerent amount, so that each cuts the space in a diﬀerent
way. In the example shown in Figure 9.5, an extra row and an extra column
of tiles have been added to the grid so that no points are left uncovered. The
two tiles highlighted are those that are present in the state indicated by the
X. The diﬀerent tilings may be oﬀset by random amounts, or by cleverly de-
signed deterministic strategies (simply oﬀsetting each dimension by the same
increment is known not to be a good idea). The eﬀects on generalization and
asymptotic accuracy illustrated in Figures 9.3 and 9.4 apply here as well. The
width and shape of the tiles should be chosen to match the width of general-
ization that one expects to be appropriate. The number of tilings should be
chosen to inﬂuence the density of tiles. The denser the tiling, the ﬁner and
more accurately the desired function can be approximated, but the greater the
computational costs.

It is important to note that the tilings can be arbitrary and need not be
uniform grids. Not only can the tiles be strangely shaped, as in Figure 9.6a,
but they can be shaped and distributed to give particular kinds of generaliza-
tion. For example, the stripe tiling in Figure 9.6b will promote generalization
along the vertical dimension and discrimination along the horizontal dimen-
sion, particularly on the left. The diagonal stripe tiling in Figure 9.6c will
promote generalization along one diagonal. In higher dimensions, axis-aligned
stripes correspond to ignoring some of the dimensions in some of the tilings,

238CHAPTER 9. ON-POLICY APPROXIMATION OF ACTION VALUES

that is, to hyperplanar slices.

Another important trick for reducing memory requirements is hashing—a
consistent pseudo-random collapsing of a large tiling into a much smaller set
of tiles. Hashing produces tiles consisting of noncontiguous, disjoint regions
randomly spread throughout the state space, but that still form an exhaustive
tiling. For example, one tile might consist of the four subtiles shown below:

Through hashing, memory requirements are often reduced by large factors with
little loss of performance. This is possible because high resolution is needed
in only a small fraction of the state space. Hashing frees us from the curse of
dimensionality in the sense that memory requirements need not be exponential
in the number of dimensions, but need merely match the real demands of the
task. Good public-domain implementations of tile coding, including hashing,
are widely available.

Radial Basis Functions

Radial basis functions (RBFs) are the natural generalization of coarse coding
to continuous-valued features. Rather than each feature being either 0 or 1,
it can be anything in the interval [0, 1], reﬂecting various degrees to which
the feature is present. A typical RBF feature, i, has a Gaussian (bell-shaped)
response xi(s) dependent only on the distance between the state, s, and the

The norm or distance metric of course can be chosen in whatever way seems
most appropriate to the states and task at hand. Figure 9.7 shows a one-
dimensional example with a Euclidean distance metric.

An RBF network is a linear function approximator using RBFs for its fea-
tures. Learning is deﬁned by equations (9.3) and (9.8), exactly as in other lin-
ear function approximators. The primary advantage of RBFs over binary fea-
tures is that they produce approximate functions that vary smoothly and are
diﬀerentiable. In addition, some learning methods for RBF networks change
the centers and widths of the features as well. Such nonlinear methods may
be able to ﬁt the target function much more precisely. The downside to RBF
networks, and to nonlinear RBF networks especially, is greater computational
complexity and, often, more manual tuning before learning is robust and eﬃ-
cient.

Kanerva Coding

On tasks with very high dimensionality, say hundreds of dimensions, tile coding
and RBF networks become impractical.
If we take either method at face
value, its computational complexity increases exponentially with the number
of dimensions. There are a number of tricks that can reduce this growth (such
as hashing), but even these become impractical after a few tens of dimensions.

On the other hand, some of the general ideas underlying these methods can
be practical for high-dimensional tasks. In particular, the idea of representing
states by a list of the features present and then mapping those features linearly
to an approximation may scale well to large tasks. The key is to keep the
number of features from scaling explosively. Is there any reason to think this
might be possible?

First we need to establish some realistic expectations. Roughly speaking, a
function approximator of a given complexity can only accurately approximate
target functions of comparable complexity. But as dimensionality increases,
the size of the state space inherently increases exponentially. It is reasonable
to assume that in the worst case the complexity of the target function scales
like the size of the state space. Thus, if we focus the worst case, then there
is no solution, no way to get good approximations for high-dimensional tasks
without using resources exponential in the dimension.

A more useful way to think about the problem is to focus on the complexity
of the target function as separate and distinct from the size and dimensionality
of the state space. The size of the state space may give an upper bound on
complexity, but short of that high bound, complexity and dimension can be
unrelated. For example, one might have a 1000-dimensional task where only
one of the dimensions happens to matter. Given a certain level of complexity,
we then seek to be able to accurately approximate any target function of that
complexity or less. As the target level of complexity increases, we would like
to get by with a proportionate increase in computational resources.

From this point of view, the real source of the problem is the complexity of
the target function, or of a reasonable approximation of it, not the dimension-
ality of the state space. Thus, adding dimensions, such as new sensors or new
features, to a task should be almost without consequence if the complexity of
the needed approximations remains the same. The new dimensions may even
make things easier if the target function can be simply expressed in terms of
them. Unfortunately, methods like tile coding and RBF coding do not work
this way. Their complexity increases exponentially with dimensionality even if
the complexity of the target function does not. For these methods, dimension-
ality itself is still a problem. We need methods whose complexity is unaﬀected

9.4. CONTROL WITH FUNCTION APPROXIMATION

241

by dimensionality per se, methods that are limited only by, and scale well
with, the complexity of what they approximate.

One simple approach that meets these criteria, which we call Kanerva
coding, is to choose binary features that correspond to particular prototype
states. For deﬁniteness, let us say that the prototypes are randomly selected
from the entire state space. The receptive ﬁeld of such a feature is all states
suﬃciently close to the prototype. Kanerva coding uses a diﬀerent kind of
distance metric than in is used in tile coding and RBFs. For deﬁniteness,
consider a binary state space and the hamming distance, the number of bits
at which two states diﬀer. States are considered similar if they agree on enough
dimensions, even if they are totally diﬀerent on others.

The strength of Kanerva coding is that the complexity of the functions
that can be learned depends entirely on the number of features, which bears
no necessary relationship to the dimensionality of the task. The number of
features can be more or less than the number of dimensions. Only in the worst
case must it be exponential in the number of dimensions. Dimensionality itself
is thus no longer a problem. Complex functions are still a problem, as they
have to be. To handle more complex tasks, a Kanerva coding approach simply
needs more features. There is not a great deal of experience with such systems,
but what there is suggests that their abilities increase in proportion to their
computational resources. This is an area of current research, and signiﬁcant
improvements in existing methods can still easily be found.

9.4 Control with Function Approximation

We now extend value prediction methods using function approximation to
control methods, following the pattern of GPI. First we extend the state-
value prediction methods to action-value prediction methods, then we combine
them with policy improvement and action selection techniques. As usual, the
problem of ensuring exploration is solved by pursuing either an on-policy or
an oﬀ-policy approach.

The extension to action-value prediction is straightforward. In this case
it is the approximate action-value function, ˆq
qπ, that is represented as a
parameterized functional form with parameter vector w. Whereas before we
Vt, now we consider ex-
considered random training examples of the form St (cid:55)→
Qt. The target output, Qt, can be any approxima-
amples of the form St, At (cid:55)→
tion of qπ(St, At), including the usual backed-up values such as the full Monte
Carlo return, Gt, or the one-step Sarsa-style return, Gt+1 + γ ˆq(St+1, At+1,wt).

The general gradient-descent update for action-value prediction is

(cid:105)
For example, the backward view of the action-value method analogous to

with e0 = 0. We call this method gradient-descent Sarsa(λ), particularly
when it is elaborated to form a full control method. For a constant policy,
this method converges in the same way that TD(λ) does, with the same kind
of error bound (9.9).

To form control methods, we need to couple such action-value prediction
methods with techniques for policy improvement and action selection. Suitable
techniques applicable to continuous actions, or to actions from large discrete
sets, are a topic of ongoing research with as yet no clear resolution. On the
other hand, if the action set is discrete and not too large, then we can use the
techniques already developed in previous chapters. That is, for each possible
action, a, available in the current state, St, we can compute ˆq(St, a,wt) and
then ﬁnd the greedy action a∗t = argmaxa ˆq(St, a,wt). Policy improvement
is done by changing the estimation policy to the greedy policy (in oﬀ-policy
methods) or to a soft approximation of the greedy policy such as the ε-greedy
policy (in on-policy methods). Actions are selected according to this same
policy in on-policy methods, or by an arbitrary policy in oﬀ-policy methods.

Figures 9.8 and 9.9 show examples of on-policy (Sarsa(λ)) and oﬀ-policy
(Watkins’s Q(λ)) control methods using function approximation. Both meth-
ods use linear, gradient-descent function approximation with binary features,
such as in tile coding and Kanerva coding. Both methods use an ε-greedy
policy for action selection, and the Sarsa method uses it for GPI as well. Both
compute the sets of present features, Fa, corresponding to the current state
and all possible actions, a.
If the value function for each action is a sepa-
rate linear function of the same features (a common case), then the indices of
the Fa for each action are essentially the same, simplifying the computation
signiﬁcantly.

9.4. CONTROL WITH FUNCTION APPROXIMATION

245

All the methods we have discussed above have used accumulating eligibility
traces. Although replacing traces (Section 7.8) are known to have advantages
in tabular methods, replacing traces do not directly extend to the use of func-
tion approximation. Recall that the idea of replacing traces is to reset a state’s
trace to 1 each time it is visited instead of incrementing it by 1. But with func-
tion approximation there is no single trace corresponding to a state, just a trace
for each component of w, which corresponds to many states. One approach
that seems to work well for linear, gradient-descent function approximation
methods with binary features is to treat the features as if they were states for
the purposes of replacing traces. That is, each time a state is encountered that
has feature i, the trace for feature i is set to 1 rather than being incremented
by 1, as it would be with accumulating traces.

When working with state–action traces, it may also be useful to clear (set
to zero) the traces of all nonselected actions in the states encountered (see
Section 7.8). This idea can also be extended to the case of linear function
approximation with binary features. For each state encountered, we ﬁrst clear
the traces of all features for the state and the actions not selected, then we set
to 1 the traces of the features for the state and the action that was selected.
As we noted for the tabular case, this may or may not be the best way to
proceed when using replacing traces. A procedural speciﬁcation of both kinds
of traces, including the optional clearing for nonselected actions, is given for
the Sarsa algorithm in Figure 9.8.

Example 9.2: Mountain–Car Task Consider the task of driving an un-
derpowered car up a steep mountain road, as suggested by the diagram in the
upper left of Figure 9.10. The diﬃculty is that gravity is stronger than the
car’s engine, and even at full throttle the car cannot accelerate up the steep
slope. The only solution is to ﬁrst move away from the goal and up the op-
posite slope on the left. Then, by applying full throttle the car can build up
enough inertia to carry it up the steep slope even though it is slowing down
the whole way. This is a simple example of a continuous control task where
things have to get worse in a sense (farther from the goal) before they can get
better. Many control methodologies have great diﬃculties with tasks of this
kind unless explicitly aided by a human designer.

The reward in this problem is

1 on all time steps until the car moves past
its goal position at the top of the mountain, which ends the episode. There are
three possible actions: full throttle forward (+1), full throttle reverse (
1),
and zero throttle (0). The car moves according to a simpliﬁed physics. Its
position, pt, and velocity, ˙pt, are updated by

The Sarsa algorithm in Figure 9.8 (using replace traces and the optional
clearing) readily solved this task, learning a near optimal policy within 100
episodes. Figure 9.10 shows the negative of the value function (the cost-to-
go function) learned on one run, using the parameters λ = 0.9, ε = 0, and
α = 0.05 (e.g., 0.5
m ). The initial action values were all zero, which was optimistic
(all true values are negative in this task), causing extensive exploration to
occur even though the exploration parameter, ε, was 0. This can be seen in
the middle-top panel of the ﬁgure, labeled “Step 428.” At this time not even
one episode had been completed, but the car has oscillated back and forth in
the valley, following circular trajectories in state space. All the states visited
frequently are valued worse than unexplored states, because the actual rewards
have been worse than what was (unrealistically) expected. This continually
drives the agent away from wherever it has been, to explore new states, until
a solution is found. Figure 9.11 shows the results of a detailed study of the

9.5 Should We Bootstrap?

At this point you may be wondering why we bother with bootstrapping meth-
ods at all. Nonbootstrapping methods can be used with function approxima-
tion more reliably and over a broader range of conditions than bootstrapping
methods. Nonbootstrapping methods achieve a lower asymptotic error than
bootstrapping methods, even when backups are done according to the on-
policy distribution. By using eligibility traces and λ = 1, it is even possible to
implement nonbootstrapping methods on-line, in a step-by-step incremental
manner. Despite all this, in practice bootstrapping methods are usually the
methods of choice.

In empirical comparisons, bootstrapping methods usually perform much
better than nonbootstrapping methods. A convenient way to make such com-
parisons is to use a TD method with eligibility traces and vary λ from 0 (pure
bootstrapping) to 1 (pure nonbootstrapping). Figure 9.12 summarizes a col-

approached 1, the nonbootstrapping case. The example in the upper right of
the ﬁgure is particularly signiﬁcant in this regard. This is a policy evaluation
(prediction) task and the performance measure used is RMSE (at the end of

we see it performing much worse.

At this time it is unclear why methods that involve some bootstrapping
perform so much better than pure nonbootstrapping methods.
It could be
that bootstrapping methods learn faster, or it could be that they actually
learn something better than nonbootstrapping methods. The available results
indicate that nonbootstrapping methods are better than bootstrapping meth-
ods at reducing RMSE from the true value function, but reducing RMSE is
not necessarily the most important goal. For example, if you add 1000 to the
true action-value function at all state–action pairs, then it will have very poor
RMSE, but you will still get the optimal policy. Nothing quite that simple is
going on with bootstrapping methods, but they do seem to do something right.
We expect the understanding of these issues to improve as research continues.

9.6 Summary

Reinforcement learning systems must be capable of generalization if they are to
be applicable to artiﬁcial intelligence or to large engineering applications. To
achieve this, any of a broad range of existing methods for supervised-learning
function approximation can be used simply by treating each backup as a train-
ing example. Gradient-descent methods, in particular, allow a natural exten-
sion to function approximation of all the techniques developed in previous
chapters, including eligibility traces. Linear gradient-descent methods are
particularly appealing theoretically and work well in practice when provided
with appropriate features. Choosing the features is one of the most important
ways of adding prior domain knowledge to reinforcement learning systems.
Linear methods include radial basis functions, tile coding, and Kanerva cod-
ing. Backpropagation methods for multilayer neural networks are methods for
nonlinear gradient-descent function approximation.

For the most part, the extension of reinforcement learning prediction and
control methods to gradient-descent forms is straightforward for the on-policy
case. On-policy bootstrapping methods converge reliably with linear gradient-
descent function approximation to a solution with mean-squared error bounded
by 1
times the minimum possible error. Bootstrapping methods are of
−

persistent interest in reinforcement learning, despite their limited theoretical
guarantees, because in practice they usually work signiﬁcantly better than
nonbootstrapping methods. The oﬀ-policy case involves considerably greater
subtlety and is postponed to a later (future) chapter.

Bibliographical and Historical Remarks

Despite our treatment of generalization and function approximation late in
the book, they have always been an integral part of reinforcement learning. It
is only in the last decade or less that the ﬁeld has focused on the tabular case,
as we have here for the ﬁrst seven chapters. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996)
present the state of the art in function approximation in reinforcement learn-
ing, and the collection of papers by Boyan, Moore, and Sutton (1995) is also
useful. Some of the early work with function approximation in reinforcement
learning is discussed at the end of this section.

9.2

9.3

Gradient-descent methods for the minimizing mean-squared error in su-
pervised learning are well known. Widrow and Hoﬀ (1960) introduced
the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, which is the prototypical in-
cremental gradient-descent algorithm. Details of this and related al-
gorithms are provided in many texts (e.g., Widrow and Stearns, 1985;
Bishop, 1995; Duda and Hart, 1973).

Gradient-descent analyses of TD learning date back at least to Sutton
(1988). Methods more sophisticated than the simple gradient-descent
methods covered in this section have also been studied in the context of
reinforcement learning, such as quasi-Newton methods (Werbos, 1990)
and recursive-least-squares methods (Bradtke, 1993, 1994; Bradtke and
Barto, 1996; Bradtke, Ydstie, and Barto, 1994). Bertsekas and Tsit-
siklis (1996) provide a good discussion of these methods.

The earliest use of state aggregation in reinforcement learning may
have been Michie and Chambers’s BOXES system (1968). The theory
of state aggregation in reinforcement learning has been developed by
Singh, Jaakkola, and Jordan (1995) and Tsitsiklis and Van Roy (1996).

TD(λ) with linear gradient-descent function approximation was ﬁrst ex-
plored by Sutton (1984, 1988), who proved convergence of TD(0) in the
mean to the minimal RMSE solution for the case in which the feature
vectors,
, are linearly independent. Convergence with
}
probability 1 for general λ was proved by several researchers at about
the same time (Peng, 1993; Dayan and Sejnowski, 1994; Tsitsiklis, 1994;
Gurvits, Lin, and Hanson, 1994). In addition, Jaakkola, Jordan, and
Singh (1994) proved convergence under on-line updating. All of these
results assumed linearly independent feature vectors, which implies at
least as many components to wt as there are states. Convergence of lin-
ear TD(λ) for the more interesting case of general (dependent) feature
vectors was ﬁrst shown by Dayan (1992). A signiﬁcant generalization

9.6. SUMMARY

251

and strengthening of Dayan’s result was proved by Tsitsiklis and Van
Roy (1997). They proved the main result presented in Section 9.2,
the bound on the asymptotic error of TD(λ) and other bootstrapping
methods. Recently they extended their analysis to the undiscounted
continuing case (Tsitsiklis and Van Roy, 1999).

Our presentation of the range of possibilities for linear function approx-
imation is based on that by Barto (1990). The term coarse coding is
due to Hinton (1984), and our Figure 9.2 is based on one of his ﬁgures.
Waltz and Fu (1965) provide an early example of this type of function
approximation in a reinforcement learning system.

Tile coding, including hashing, was introduced by Albus (1971, 1981).
He described it in terms of his “cerebellar model articulator controller,”
or CMAC, as tile coding is known in the literature. The term “tile
coding” is new to this book, though the idea of describing CMAC in
these terms is taken from Watkins (1989). Tile coding has been used in
many reinforcement learning systems (e.g., Shewchuk and Dean, 1990;
Lin and Kim, 1991; Miller, Scalera, and Kim, 1994; Sofge and White,
1992; Tham, 1994; Sutton, 1996; Watkins, 1989) as well as in other
types of learning control systems (e.g., Kraft and Campagna, 1990;
Kraft, Miller, and Dietz, 1992).

Function approximation using radial basis functions (RBFs) has re-
ceived wide attention ever since being related to neural networks by
Broomhead and Lowe (1988). Powell (1987) reviewed earlier uses of
RBFs, and Poggio and Girosi (1989, 1990) extensively developed and
applied this approach.

What we call “Kanerva coding” was introduced by Kanerva (1988) as
part of his more general idea of sparse distributed memory. A good re-
view of this and related memory models is provided by Kanerva (1993).
This approach has been pursued by Gallant (1993) and by Sutton and
Whitehead (1993), among others.

9.4

Q(λ) with function approximation was ﬁrst explored by Watkins (1989).
Sarsa(λ) with function approximation was ﬁrst explored by Rummery
and Niranjan (1994). The mountain–car example is based on a similar
task studied by Moore (1990). The results on it presented here are from
Sutton (1996) and Singh and Sutton (1996).

Convergence of the Sarsa control method presented in this section has
not been proved. The Q-learning control method is now known not
to be sound and will diverge for some problems. Convergence results
for control methods with state aggregation and other special kinds of

252CHAPTER 9. ON-POLICY APPROXIMATION OF ACTION VALUES

function approximation are proved by Tsitsiklis and Van Roy (1996),
Singh, Jaakkola, and Jordan (1995), and Gordon (1995).

The use of function approximation in reinforcement learning goes back to
the early neural networks of Farley and Clark (1954; Clark and Farley, 1955),
who used reinforcement learning to adjust the parameters of linear threshold
functions representing policies. The earliest example we know of in which
function approximation methods were used for learning value functions was
Samuel’s checkers player (1959, 1967).
Samuel followed Shannon’s (1950)
suggestion that a value function did not have to be exact to be a useful guide
to selecting moves in a game and that it might be approximated by linear
combination of features. In addition to linear function approximation, Samuel
experimented with lookup tables and hierarchical lookup tables called signa-
ture tables (Griﬃth, 1966, 1974; Page, 1977; Biermann, Fairﬁeld, and Beres,
1982).

At about the same time as Samuel’s work, Bellman and Dreyfus (1959)
proposed using function approximation methods with DP. (It is tempting to
think that Bellman and Samuel had some inﬂuence on one another, but we
know of no reference to the other in the work of either.) There is now a
fairly extensive literature on function approximation methods and DP, such
as multigrid methods and methods using splines and orthogonal polynomials
(e.g., Bellman and Dreyfus, 1959; Bellman, Kalaba, and Kotkin, 1973; Daniel,
1976; Whitt, 1978; Reetz, 1977; Schweitzer and Seidmann, 1985; Chow and
Tsitsiklis, 1991; Kushner and Dupuis, 1992; Rust, 1996).

Holland’s (1986) classiﬁer system used a selective feature-match technique
to generalize evaluation information across state–action pairs. Each classiﬁer
matched a subset of states having speciﬁed values for a subset of features, with
the remaining features having arbitrary values (“wild cards”). These subsets
were then used in a conventional state-aggregation approach to function ap-
proximation. Holland’s idea was to use a genetic algorithm to evolve a set
of classiﬁers that collectively would implement a useful action-value function.
Holland’s ideas inﬂuenced the early research of the authors on reinforcement
learning, but we focused on diﬀerent approaches to function approximation.
As function approximators, classiﬁers are limited in several ways. First, they
are state-aggregation methods, with concomitant limitations in scaling and in
representing smooth functions eﬃciently. In addition, the matching rules of
classiﬁers can implement only aggregation boundaries that are parallel to the
feature axes. Perhaps the most important limitation of conventional classi-
ﬁer systems is that the classiﬁers are learned via the genetic algorithm, an
evolutionary method. As we discussed in Chapter 1, there is available dur-
ing learning much more detailed information about how to learn than can be

9.6. SUMMARY

253

used by evolutionary methods. This perspective led us to instead adapt super-
vised learning methods for use in reinforcement learning, speciﬁcally gradient-
descent and neural network methods. These diﬀerences between Holland’s
approach and ours are not surprising because Holland’s ideas were developed
during a period when neural networks were generally regarded as being too
weak in computational power to be useful, whereas our work was at the be-
ginning of the period that saw widespread questioning of that conventional
wisdom. There remain many opportunities for combining aspects of these
diﬀerent approaches.

A number of reinforcement learning studies using function approximation
methods that we have not covered previously should be mentioned. Barto,
Sutton, and Brouwer (1981) and Barto and Sutton (1981b) extended the idea
of an associative memory network (e.g., Kohonen, 1977; Anderson, Silverstein,
Ritz, and Jones, 1977) to reinforcement learning. Hampson (1983, 1989) was
an early proponent of multilayer neural networks for learning value functions.
Anderson (1986, 1987) coupled a TD algorithm with the error backpropagation
algorithm to learn a value function. Barto and Anandan (1985) introduced a
stochastic version of Widrow, Gupta, and Maitra’s (1973) selective bootstrap
algorithm, which they called the associative reward-penalty (AR
P ) algorithm.
Williams (1986, 1987, 1988, 1992) extended this type of algorithm to a general
class of REINFORCE algorithms, showing that they perform stochastic gra-
dient ascent on the expected reinforcement. Gullapalli (1990) and Williams
devised algorithms for learning generalizing policies for the case of continuous
actions. Phansalkar and Thathachar (1995) proved both local and global con-
vergence theorems for modiﬁed versions of REINFORCE algorithms. Chris-
tensen and Korf (1986) experimented with regression methods for modifying
coeﬃcients of linear value function approximations in the game of chess. Chap-
man and Kaelbling (1991) and Tan (1991) adapted decision-tree methods for
learning value functions. Explanation-based learning methods have also been
adapted for learning value functions, yielding compact representations (Yee,
Saxena, Utgoﬀ, and Barto, 1990; Dietterich and Flann, 1995).

Policy Approximation

All of the methods we have considered so far in this book have learned the
values of states or state–action pairs. To use them for control, we learned
the values of state–action pairs, and then used those action values directly to
implement the policy (e.g., ε-greedy) and select actions. All methods of this
form can be called action-value methods.

In this chapter we explore methods that are not action-value methods.
They may still compute action (or state) values, but they do not use them
directly to select actions. Instead, the policy is represented directly, with its
own weights independent of any value function.

11.1 Actor–Critic Methods

Actor–critic methods are TD methods that have a separate memory structure
to explicitly represent the policy independent of the value function. The policy
structure is known as the actor, because it is used to select actions, and the
estimated value function is known as the critic, because it criticizes the actions
made by the actor. Learning is always on-policy: the critic must learn about
and critique whatever policy is currently being followed by the actor. The
critique takes the form of a TD error. This scalar signal is the sole output
of the critic and drives all learning in both actor and critic, as suggested by
Figure 11.1.

Actor–critic methods are the natural extension of the idea of gradient-
bandit methods (Section 2.7) to TD learning and to the full reinforcement
learning problem. Typically, the critic is a state-value function. After each
action selection, the critic evaluates the new state to determine whether things
have gone better or worse than expected. That evaluation is the TD error:

δt = Rt+1 + γVt(St+1)

V (St),

−

where Vt is the value function implemented by the critic at time t. This TD
error can be used to evaluate the action just selected, the action At taken in
state St. If the TD error is positive, it suggests that the tendency to select At
should be strengthened for the future, whereas if the TD error is negative, it
suggests the tendency should be weakened. Suppose actions are generated by
the Gibbs softmax method:

πt(a

s) = Pr

{

At = a

St = s

=

}

|

eHt(s,a)
b eHt(s,b) ,

(cid:80)
where the Ht(s, a) are the values at time t of the modiﬁable policy parameters
of the actor, indicating the tendency to select (preference for) each action a
when in each state s at time t. Then the strengthening or weakening described
above can be implemented by increasing or decreasing Ht(St, At), for instance,
by

Ht+1(St, At) = Ht(St, At) + βδt,

where β is another positive step-size parameter.

This is just one example of an actor–critic method. Other variations select
the actions in diﬀerent ways, or use eligibility traces like those described in the

next chapter. Another common dimension of variation, as in reinforcement
comparison methods, is to include additional factors varying the amount of
credit assigned to the action taken, At. For example, one of the most common
such factors is inversely related to the probability of selecting At, resulting in
the update rule:

Ht(St, At) = Ht(St, At) + βδt

Many of the earliest reinforcement learning systems that used TD methods
were actor–critic methods (Witten, 1977; Barto, Sutton, and Anderson, 1983).
Since then, more attention has been devoted to methods that learn action-value
functions and determine a policy exclusively from the estimated values (such
as Sarsa and Q-learning). This divergence may be just historical accident.
For example, one could imagine intermediate architectures in which both an
action-value function and an independent policy would be learned.
In any
event, actor–critic methods are likely to remain of current interest because of
two signiﬁcant apparent advantages:

•

•

They require minimal computation in order to select actions. Consider a
case where there are an inﬁnite number of possible actions—for example,
a continuous-valued action. Any method learning just action values must
search through this inﬁnite set in order to pick an action. If the policy
is explicitly stored, then this extensive computation may not be needed
for each action selection.

They can learn an explicitly stochastic policy; that is, they can learn
the optimal probabilities of selecting various actions. This ability turns
out to be useful in competitive and non-Markov cases (e.g., see Singh,
Jaakkola, and Jordan, 1994).

In addition, the separate actor in actor–critic methods makes them more ap-
pealing in some respects as psychological and biological models. In some cases
it may also make it easier to impose domain-speciﬁc constraints on the set of
allowed policies.

11.2 Eligibility Traces for Actor–Critic Meth-

ods

In this section we describe how to extend the actor–critic methods introduced
in Section 11.1 to use eligibility traces. This is fairly straightforward. The

260

CHAPTER 11. POLICY APPROXIMATION

critic part of an actor–critic method is simply on-policy learning of vπ. The
TD(λ) algorithm can be used for that, with one eligibility trace for each state.
The actor part needs to use an eligibility trace for each state–action pair.
Thus, an actor–critic method needs two sets of traces, one for each state and
one for each state–action pair.

Recall that the one-step actor–critic method updates the actor by

Ht+1(s, a) =

(cid:26)

Ht(s, a) + αδt
Ht(s, a)

if a = At and s = St
otherwise,

where δt is the TD(λ) error (7.10), and Ht(s, a) is the preference for taking
action a at time t if in state s. The preferences determine the policy via, for
example, a softmax method (Section 2.3). We generalize the above equation
to use eligibility traces as follows:

Ht+1(s, a) = Ht(s, a) + αδt Et(s, a),

(11.1)

where Et(s, a) denotes the trace at time t for state–action pair s, a. For the
simplest case mentioned above, the trace can be updated as in Sarsa(λ).

In Section 11.1 we also discussed a more sophisticated actor–critic method

that uses the update

Ht+1(s, a) =

(cid:26)

Ht(s, a) + αδt[1
Ht(s, a)

s)]
πt(a
|

−

if a = At and s = St
otherwise.

To generalize this equation to eligibility traces we can use the same update
(11.1) with a slightly diﬀerent trace. Rather than incrementing the trace by 1
each time a state–action pair occurs, it is updated by 1

πt(St, At):

11.3 R-Learning and the Average-Reward Set-

ting

When the policy is approximated, we generally have to abandon the discounted-
reward setting that we have relied on up to now. We replace it with the
average-reward setting, which we discuss in this section.

R-learning is an oﬀ-policy control method for the advanced version of the
reinforcement learning problem in which one neither discounts nor divides

11.3. R-LEARNING AND THE AVERAGE-REWARD SETTING

261

experience into distinct episodes with ﬁnite returns.
In this average-reward
setting, one seeks to maximize the average reward per time step. The value
functions for a policy, π, are deﬁned relative to the average expected reward
per step under the policy, ¯r(π):

¯r(π) = lim
→∞

n

Eπ[Rt] .

1
n

n

t=1
(cid:88)

This average reward is well deﬁned if we assume that the process is ergodic
(nonzero probability of reaching any state from any other under any policy),
and thus that ¯r(π) does not depend on the starting state. From any state, in
the long run the average reward is the same, but there is a transient. From
some states better-than-average rewards are received for a while, and from
others worse-than-average rewards are received. It is this transient that deﬁnes
the value of a state:

vπ(s) =

∞

(cid:88)k=1

Eπ[Rt+k −

¯r(π)

|

St = s] ,

and the value of a state–action pair is similarly the transient diﬀerence in
reward when starting in that state and taking that action:

qπ(s, a) =

∞

(cid:88)k=1

Eπ[Rt+k −

¯r(π)

|

St = s, At = a] .

We call these relative values because they are relative to the average reward
under the current policy.

There are subtle distinctions that need to be drawn between diﬀerent kinds
of optimality in the undiscounted continuing case. Nevertheless, for most
practical purposes it may be adequate simply to order policies according to
their average reward per time step, in other words, according to their ¯r(π).
For now let us consider all policies that attain the maximal value of ¯r(π) to
be optimal.

Other than its use of relative values, R-learning is a standard TD control
method based on oﬀ-policy GPI, much like Q-learning. It maintains two poli-
cies, a behavior policy and an estimation policy, plus an action-value function
and an estimated average reward. The behavior policy is used to generate
experience; it might be the ε-greedy policy with respect to the action-value
function. The estimation policy is the one involved in GPI. It is typically the
greedy policy with respect to the action-value function. If π is the estimation
policy, then the action-value function, Q, is an approximation of qπ and the
average reward, ¯R, is an approximation of ¯r(π). The complete algorithm is
given in Figure 11.2.

Example 11.1: An Access-Control Queuing Task This is a decision
task involving access control to a set of n servers. Customers of four diﬀerent
priorities arrive at a single queue. If given access to a server, the customers
pay a reward of 1, 2, 4, or 8, depending on their priority, with higher priority
customers paying more. In each time step, the customer at the head of the
queue is either accepted (assigned to one of the servers) or rejected (removed
from the queue).
In either case, on the next time step the next customer
in the queue is considered. The queue never empties, and the proportion of
(randomly distributed) high priority customers in the queue is h. Of course a
customer can be served only if there is a free server. Each busy server becomes
free with probability p on each time step. Although we have just described
them for deﬁniteness, let us assume the statistics of arrivals and departures are
unknown. The task is to decide on each step whether to accept or reject the
next customer, on the basis of his priority and the number of free servers, so
as to maximize long-term reward without discounting. Figure 11.3 shows the
solution found by R-learning for this task with n = 10, h = 0.5, and p = 0.06.
The R-learning parameters were α = 0.01, β = 0.01, and (cid:15) = 0.1. The initial
action values and ¯R were zero.

Applications and Case Studies

In this ﬁnal chapter we present a few case studies of reinforcement learning.
Several of these are substantial applications of potential economic signiﬁcance.
One, Samuel’s checkers player, is primarily of historical interest. Our presen-
tations are intended to illustrate some of the trade-oﬀs and issues that arise in
real applications. For example, we emphasize how domain knowledge is incor-
porated into the formulation and solution of the problem. We also highlight
the representation issues that are so often critical to successful applications.
The algorithms used in some of these case studies are substantially more com-
plex than those we have presented in the rest of the book. Applications of
reinforcement learning are still far from routine and typically require as much
art as science. Making applications easier and more straightforward is one of
the goals of current research in reinforcement learning.

14.1 TD-Gammon

One of the most impressive applications of reinforcement learning to date is
that by Gerry Tesauro to the game of backgammon (Tesauro, 1992, 1994,
1995). Tesauro’s program, TD-Gammon, required little backgammon knowl-
edge, yet learned to play extremely well, near the level of the world’s strongest
grandmasters. The learning algorithm in TD-Gammon was a straightforward
combination of the TD(λ) algorithm and nonlinear function approximation
using a multilayer neural network trained by backpropagating TD errors.

Backgammon is a major game in the sense that it is played throughout the
world, with numerous tournaments and regular world championship matches.
It is in part a game of chance, and it is a popular vehicle for waging signiﬁcant
sums of money. There are probably more professional backgammon players

273

274

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

Figure 14.1: A backgammon position

than there are professional chess players. The game is played with 15 white
and 15 black pieces on a board of 24 locations, called points. Figure 14.1 shows
a typical position early in the game, seen from the perspective of the white
player.

In this ﬁgure, white has just rolled the dice and obtained a 5 and a 2. This
means that he can move one of his pieces 5 steps and one (possibly the same
piece) 2 steps. For example, he could move two pieces from the 12 point, one
to the 17 point, and one to the 14 point. White’s objective is to advance all of
his pieces into the last quadrant (points 19–24) and then oﬀ the board. The
ﬁrst player to remove all his pieces wins. One complication is that the pieces
interact as they pass each other going in diﬀerent directions. For example, if
it were black’s move in Figure 14.1, he could use the dice roll of 2 to move a
piece from the 24 point to the 22 point, “hitting” the white piece there. Pieces
that have been hit are placed on the “bar” in the middle of the board (where
we already see one previously hit black piece), from whence they reenter the
race from the start. However, if there are two pieces on a point, then the
opponent cannot move to that point; the pieces are protected from being hit.
Thus, white cannot use his 5–2 dice roll to move either of his pieces on the 1
point, because their possible resulting points are occupied by groups of black
pieces. Forming contiguous blocks of occupied points to block the opponent is
one of the elementary strategies of the game.

Backgammon involves several further complications, but the above descrip-
tion gives the basic idea. With 30 pieces and 24 possible locations (26, count-
ing the bar and oﬀ-the-board) it should be clear that the number of possible
backgammon positions is enormous, far more than the number of memory el-
ements one could have in any physically realizable computer. The number of
moves possible from each position is also large. For a typical dice roll there
might be 20 diﬀerent ways of playing. In considering future moves, such as

the response of the opponent, one must consider the possible dice rolls as well.
The result is that the game tree has an eﬀective branching factor of about 400.
This is far too large to permit eﬀective use of the conventional heuristic search
methods that have proved so eﬀective in games like chess and checkers.

On the other hand, the game is a good match to the capabilities of TD
learning methods. Although the game is highly stochastic, a complete de-
scription of the game’s state is available at all times. The game evolves over
a sequence of moves and positions until ﬁnally ending in a win for one player
or the other, ending the game. The outcome can be interpreted as a ﬁnal
reward to be predicted. On the other hand, the theoretical results we have
described so far cannot be usefully applied to this task. The number of states
is so large that a lookup table cannot be used, and the opponent is a source
of uncertainty and time variation.

TD-Gammon used a nonlinear form of TD(λ). The estimated value, ˆv(s),of
any state (board position) s was meant to estimate the probability of winning
starting from state s. To achieve this, rewards were deﬁned as zero for all
time steps except those on which the game is won. To implement the value
function, TD-Gammon used a standard multilayer neural network, much as
shown in Figure 14.2. (The real network had two additional units in its ﬁnal
layer to estimate the probability of each player’s winning in a special way
called a “gammon” or “backgammon.”) The network consisted of a layer of
input units, a layer of hidden units, and a ﬁnal output unit. The input to the
network was a representation of a backgammon position, and the output was
an estimate of the value of that position.

In the ﬁrst version of TD-Gammon, TD-Gammon 0.0, backgammon posi-
tions were represented to the network in a relatively direct way that involved
little backgammon knowledge. It did, however, involve substantial knowledge

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

of how neural networks work and how information is best presented to them.
It is instructive to note the exact representation Tesauro chose. There were a
total of 198 input units to the network. For each point on the backgammon
board, four units indicated the number of white pieces on the point. If there
were no white pieces, then all four units took on the value zero. If there was
one piece, then the ﬁrst unit took on the value 1. If there were two pieces,
then both the ﬁrst and the second unit were 1. If there were three or more
pieces on the point, then all of the ﬁrst three units were 1. If there were more
than three pieces, the fourth unit also came on, to a degree indicating the
number of additional pieces beyond three. Letting n denote the total num-
ber of pieces on the point, if n > 3, then the fourth unit took on the value
3)/2. With four units for white and four for black at each of the 24 points,
(n
that made a total of 192 units. Two additional units encoded the number of
white and black pieces on the bar (each took the value n/2, where n is the
number of pieces on the bar), and two more encoded the number of black and
white pieces already successfully removed from the board (these took the value
n/15, where n is the number of pieces already borne oﬀ). Finally, two units
indicated in a binary fashion whether it was white’s or black’s turn to move.
The general logic behind these choices should be clear. Basically, Tesauro
tried to represent the position in a straightforward way, making little attempt
to minimize the number of units. He provided one unit for each conceptually
distinct possibility that seemed likely to be relevant, and he scaled them to
roughly the same range, in this case between 0 and 1.

Given a representation of a backgammon position, the network computed
its estimated value in the standard way. Corresponding to each connection
from an input unit to a hidden unit was a real-valued weight. Signals from
each input unit were multiplied by their corresponding weights and summed
at the hidden unit. The output, h(j), of hidden unit j was a nonlinear sigmoid
function of the weighted sum:

h(j) = σ

,

where xi is the value of the ith input unit and wij is the weight of its connection
to the jth hidden unit. The output of the sigmoid is always between 0 and
1, and has a natural interpretation as a probability based on a summation of
evidence. The computation from hidden units to the output unit was entirely
analogous. Each connection from a hidden unit to the output unit had a
separate weight. The output unit formed the weighted sum and then passed
it through the same sigmoid nonlinearity.

TD-Gammon used the gradient-descent form of the TD(λ) algorithm de-
scribed in Section 9.2, with the gradients computed by the error backpropa-

with e0 = 0. The gradient in this equation can be computed eﬃciently by the
backpropagation procedure. For the backgammon application, in which γ = 1
and the reward is always zero except upon winning, the TD error portion of the
ˆv(St,w), as suggested in Figure 14.2.
learning rule is usually just ˆv(St+1,w)

−

To apply the learning rule we need a source of backgammon games. Tesauro
obtained an unending sequence of games by playing his learning backgammon
player against itself. To choose its moves, TD-Gammon considered each of the
20 or so ways it could play its dice roll and the corresponding positions that
would result. The resulting positions are afterstates as discussed in Section 6.6.
The network was consulted to estimate each of their values. The move was
then selected that would lead to the position with the highest estimated value.
Continuing in this way, with TD-Gammon making the moves for both sides,
it was possible to easily generate large numbers of backgammon games. Each
game was treated as an episode, with the sequence of positions acting as
the states, S0, S1, S2, . . .. Tesauro applied the nonlinear TD rule (14.1) fully
incrementally, that is, after each individual move.

The weights of the network were set initially to small random values. The
initial evaluations were thus entirely arbitrary. Since the moves were selected
on the basis of these evaluations, the initial moves were inevitably poor, and
the initial games often lasted hundreds or thousands of moves before one side
or the other won, almost by accident. After a few dozen games however,
performance improved rapidly.

After playing about 300,000 games against itself, TD-Gammon 0.0 as de-
scribed above learned to play approximately as well as the best previous
backgammon computer programs. This was a striking result because all the
previous high-performance computer programs had used extensive backgam-
mon knowledge. For example, the reigning champion program at the time
was, arguably, Neurogammon, another program written by Tesauro that used
a neural network but not TD learning. Neurogammon’s network was trained
on a large training corpus of exemplary moves provided by backgammon ex-
perts, and, in addition, started with a set of features specially crafted for

Table 14.1: Summary of TD-Gammon Results

backgammon. Neurogammon was a highly tuned, highly eﬀective backgam-
mon program that decisively won the World Backgammon Olympiad in 1989.
TD-Gammon 0.0, on the other hand, was constructed with essentially zero
backgammon knowledge. That it was able to do as well as Neurogammon and
all other approaches is striking testimony to the potential of self-play learning
methods.

The tournament success of TD-Gammon 0.0 with zero backgammon knowl-
edge suggested an obvious modiﬁcation: add the specialized backgammon
features but keep the self-play TD learning method. This produced TD-
Gammon 1.0. TD-Gammon 1.0 was clearly substantially better than all previ-
ous backgammon programs and found serious competition only among human
experts. Later versions of the program, TD-Gammon 2.0 (40 hidden units)
and TD-Gammon 2.1 (80 hidden units), were augmented with a selective two-
ply search procedure. To select moves, these programs looked ahead not just
to the positions that would immediately result, but also to the opponent’s pos-
sible dice rolls and moves. Assuming the opponent always took the move that
appeared immediately best for him, the expected value of each candidate move
was computed and the best was selected. To save computer time, the second
ply of search was conducted only for candidate moves that were ranked highly
after the ﬁrst ply, about four or ﬁve moves on average. Two-ply search aﬀected
only the moves selected; the learning process proceeded exactly as before. The
most recent version of the program, TD-Gammon 3.0, uses 160 hidden units
and a selective three-ply search. TD-Gammon illustrates the combination of
learned value functions and decide-time search as in heuristic search meth-
ods. In more recent work, Tesauro and Galperin (1997) have begun exploring
trajectory sampling methods as an alternative to search.

Tesauro was able to play his programs in a signiﬁcant number of games
against world-class human players. A summary of the results is given in Ta-
ble 14.1. Based on these results and analyses by backgammon grandmasters
(Robertie, 1992; see Tesauro, 1995), TD-Gammon 3.0 appears to be at, or
very near, the playing strength of the best human players in the world.
It
may already be the world champion. These programs have already changed

14.2. SAMUEL’S CHECKERS PLAYER

279

the way the best human players play the game. For example, TD-Gammon
learned to play certain opening positions diﬀerently than was the convention
among the best human players. Based on TD-Gammon’s success and further
analysis, the best human players now play these positions as TD-Gammon
does (Tesauro, 1995).

14.2 Samuel’s Checkers Player

An important precursor to Tesauro’s TD-Gammon was the seminal work of
Arthur Samuel (1959, 1967) in constructing programs for learning to play
checkers. Samuel was one of the ﬁrst to make eﬀective use of heuristic search
methods and of what we would now call temporal-diﬀerence learning. His
checkers players are instructive case studies in addition to being of historical
interest. We emphasize the relationship of Samuel’s methods to modern re-
inforcement learning methods and try to convey some of Samuel’s motivation
for using them.

Samuel ﬁrst wrote a checkers-playing program for the IBM 701 in 1952.
His ﬁrst learning program was completed in 1955 and was demonstrated on
television in 1956. Later versions of the program achieved good, though not
expert, playing skill. Samuel was attracted to game-playing as a domain for
studying machine learning because games are less complicated than problems
“taken from life” while still allowing fruitful study of how heuristic procedures
and learning can be used together. He chose to study checkers instead of
chess because its relative simplicity made it possible to focus more strongly on
learning.

Samuel’s programs played by performing a lookahead search from each
current position. They used what we now call heuristic search methods to
determine how to expand the search tree and when to stop searching. The
terminal board positions of each search were evaluated, or “scored,” by a
value function, or “scoring polynomial,” using linear function approximation.
In this and other respects Samuel’s work seems to have been inspired by the
suggestions of Shannon (1950). In particular, Samuel’s program was based on
Shannon’s minimax procedure to ﬁnd the best move from the current position.
Working backward through the search tree from the scored terminal positions,
each position was given the score of the position that would result from the
best move, assuming that the machine would always try to maximize the score,
while the opponent would always try to minimize it. Samuel called this the
backed-up score of the position. When the minimax procedure reached the
search tree’s root—the current position—it yielded the best move under the
assumption that the opponent would be using the same evaluation criterion,

280

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

shifted to its point of view. Some versions of Samuel’s programs used sophis-
ticated search control methods analogous to what are known as “alpha-beta”
cutoﬀs (e.g., see Pearl, 1984).

Samuel used two main learning methods, the simplest of which he called
rote learning. It consisted simply of saving a description of each board position
encountered during play together with its backed-up value determined by the
minimax procedure. The result was that if a position that had already been
encountered were to occur again as a terminal position of a search tree, the
depth of the search was eﬀectively ampliﬁed since this position’s stored value
cached the results of one or more searches conducted earlier. One initial prob-
lem was that the program was not encouraged to move along the most direct
path to a win. Samuel gave it a “a sense of direction” by decreasing a position’s
value a small amount each time it was backed up a level (called a ply) during
the minimax analysis. “If the program is now faced with a choice of board
positions whose scores diﬀer only by the ply number, it will automatically
make the most advantageous choice, choosing a low-ply alternative if winning
and a high-ply alternative if losing” (Samuel, 1959, p. 80). Samuel found this
discounting-like technique essential to successful learning. Rote learning pro-
duced slow but continuous improvement that was most eﬀective for opening
and endgame play. His program became a “better-than-average novice” after
learning from many games against itself, a variety of human opponents, and
from book games in a supervised learning mode.

Rote learning and other aspects of Samuel’s work strongly suggest the
essential idea of temporal-diﬀerence learning—that the value of a state should
equal the value of likely following states. Samuel came closest to this idea
in his second learning method, his “learning by generalization” procedure for
modifying the parameters of the value function. Samuel’s method was the same
in concept as that used much later by Tesauro in TD-Gammon. He played
his program many games against another version of itself and performed a
backup operation after each move. The idea of Samuel’s backup is suggested
by the diagram in Figure 14.3. Each open circle represents a position where
the program moves next, an on-move position, and each solid circle represents
a position where the opponent moves next. A backup was made to the value of
each on-move position after a move by each side, resulting in a second on-move
position. The backup was toward the minimax value of a search launched from
the second on-move position. Thus, the overall eﬀect was that of a backup
consisting of one full move of real events and then a search over possible events,
as suggested by Figure 14.3. Samuel’s actual algorithm was signiﬁcantly more
complex than this for computational reasons, but this was the basic idea.

Samuel did not include explicit rewards. Instead, he ﬁxed the weight of the
most important feature, the piece advantage feature, which measured the num-

ber of pieces the program had relative to how many its opponent had, giving
higher weight to kings, and including reﬁnements so that it was better to trade
pieces when winning than when losing. Thus, the goal of Samuel’s program
was to improve its piece advantage, which in checkers is highly correlated with
winning.

However, Samuel’s learning method may have been missing an essential
part of a sound temporal-diﬀerence algorithm. Temporal-diﬀerence learning
can be viewed as a way of making a value function consistent with itself, and
this we can clearly see in Samuel’s method. But also needed is a way of tying
the value function to the true value of the states. We have enforced this via
rewards and by discounting or giving a ﬁxed value to the terminal state. But
Samuel’s method included no rewards and no special treatment of the terminal
positions of games. As Samuel himself pointed out, his value function could
have become consistent merely by giving a constant value to all positions.
He hoped to discourage such solutions by giving his piece-advantage term a
large, nonmodiﬁable weight. But although this may decrease the likelihood of
ﬁnding useless evaluation functions, it does not prohibit them. For example,
a constant function could still be attained by setting the modiﬁable weights
so as to cancel the eﬀect of the nonmodiﬁable one.

Since Samuel’s learning procedure was not constrained to ﬁnd useful eval-
uation functions, it should have been possible for it to become worse with
experience. In fact, Samuel reported observing this during extensive self-play
training sessions. To get the program improving again, Samuel had to in-
tervene and set the weight with the largest absolute value back to zero. His
interpretation was that this drastic intervention jarred the program out of local
optima, but another possibility is that it jarred the program out of evaluation

functions that were consistent but had little to do with winning or losing the
game.

Despite these potential problems, Samuel’s checkers player using the gener-
alization learning method approached “better-than-average” play. Fairly good
amateur opponents characterized it as “tricky but beatable” (Samuel, 1959).
In contrast to the rote-learning version, this version was able to develop a
good middle game but remained weak in opening and endgame play. This
program also included an ability to search through sets of features to ﬁnd
those that were most useful in forming the value function. A later version
(Samuel, 1967) included reﬁnements in its search procedure, such as alpha-
beta pruning, extensive use of a supervised learning mode called “book learn-
ing,” and hierarchical lookup tables called signature tables (Griﬃth, 1966) to
represent the value function instead of linear function approximation. This
version learned to play much better than the 1959 program, though still not
at a master level. Samuel’s checkers-playing program was widely recognized
as a signiﬁcant achievement in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning.

14.3 The Acrobot

Reinforcement learning has been applied to a wide variety of physical control
tasks (e.g., for a collection of robotics applications, see Connell and Mahade-
van, 1993). One such task is the acrobot, a two-link, underactuated robot
roughly analogous to a gymnast swinging on a high bar (Figure 14.4). The ﬁrst
joint (corresponding to the gymnast’s hands on the bar) cannot exert torque,
but the second joint (corresponding to the gymnast bending at the waist)
can. The system has four continuous state variables: two joint positions and
two joint velocities. The equations of motion are given in Figure 14.5. This
system has been widely studied by control engineers (e.g., Spong, 1994) and
machine-learning researchers (e.g., Dejong and Spong, 1994; Boone, 1997).

One objective for controlling the acrobot is to swing the tip (the “feet”)
above the ﬁrst joint by an amount equal to one of the links in minimum time.
In this task, the torque applied at the second joint is limited to three choices:
positive torque of a ﬁxed magnitude, negative torque of the same magnitude,
1 is given on all time steps until the goal is reached,
or no torque. A reward of
which ends the episode. No discounting is used (γ = 1). Thus, the optimal
value, v
(s), of any state, s, is the minimum time to reach the goal (an integer
∗
number of steps) starting from s.

Sutton (1996) addressed the acrobot swing-up task in an on-line, modelfree
context. Although the acrobot was simulated, the simulator was not available

for use by the agent/controller in any way. The training and interaction were
just as if a real, physical acrobot had been used. Each episode began with
both links of the acrobot hanging straight down and at rest. Torques were
applied by the reinforcement learning agent until the goal was reached, which
always happened eventually. Then the acrobot was restored to its initial rest
position and a new episode was begun.

The learning algorithm used was Sarsa(λ) with linear function approxima-
tion, tile coding, and replacing traces as in Figure 9.8. With a small, discrete
action set, it is natural to use a separate set of tilings for each action. The
next choice is of the continuous variables with which to represent the state.
A clever designer would probably represent the state in terms of the angular
position and velocity of the center of mass and of the second link, which might
make the solution simpler and consistent with broad generalization. But since
this was just a test problem, a more naive, direct representation was used in
terms of the positions and velocities of the links: θ1, ˙θ1, θ2, and ˙θ2. The two
angles are restricted to a limited range by the physics of the acrobot (see Fig-
ure 14.5) and the two angles are naturally restricted to [0, 2π]. Thus, the state
space in this task is a bounded rectangular region in four dimensions.

This leaves the question of what tilings to use. There are many possi-
bilities, as discussed in Chapter 9. One is to use a complete grid, slicing
the four-dimensional space along all dimensions, and thus into many small
four-dimensional tiles. Alternatively, one could slice along only one of the
dimensions, making hyperplanar stripes. In this case one has to pick which
dimension to slice along. And of course in all cases one has to pick the width of
the slices, the number of tilings of each kind, and, if there are multiple tilings,
how to oﬀset them. One could also slice along pairs or triplets of dimensions
to get other tilings. For example, if one expected the velocities of the two links
to interact strongly in their eﬀect on value, then one might make many tilings
that sliced along both of these dimensions. If one thought the region around
zero velocity was particularly critical, then the slices could be more closely
spaced there.

Sutton used tilings that sliced in a variety of simple ways. Each of the four
dimensions was divided into six equal intervals. A seventh interval was added
to the angular velocities so that tilings could be oﬀset by a random fraction
of an interval in all dimensions (see Chapter 9, subsection “Tile Coding”). Of
the total of 48 tilings, 12 sliced along all four dimensions as discussed above,
dividing the space into 6
7 = 1764 tiles each. Another 12 tilings sliced
along three dimensions (3 randomly oﬀset tilings each for each of the 4 sets of
three dimensions), and another 12 sliced along two dimensions (2 tilings for
each of the 6 sets of two dimensions. Finally, a set of 12 tilings depended each
on only one dimension (3 tilings for each of the 4 dimensions). This resulted

in a total of approximately 25, 000 tiles for each action. This number is small
enough that hashing was not necessary. All tilings were oﬀset by a random
fraction of an interval in all relevant dimensions.

The remaining parameters of the learning algorithm were α = 0.2/48,
λ = 0.9, (cid:15) = 0, and w0 = 0. The use of a greedy policy (ε = 0) seemed
preferable on this task because long sequences of correct actions are needed to
do well. One exploratory action could spoil a whole sequence of good actions.
Exploration was ensured instead by starting the action values optimistically, at
the low value of 0. As discussed in Section 2.7 and Example 9.2, this makes the
agent continually disappointed with whatever rewards it initially experiences,
driving it to keep trying new things.

Figure 14.6 shows learning curves for the acrobot task and the learning al-
gorithm described above. Note from the single-run curve that single episodes
were sometimes extremely long. On these episodes, the acrobot was usu-
ally spinning repeatedly at the second joint while the ﬁrst joint changed only
slightly from vertical down. Although this often happened for many time steps,
it always eventually ended as the action values were driven lower. All runs
ended with an eﬃcient policy for solving the problem, usually lasting about
75 steps. A typical ﬁnal solution is shown in Figure 14.7. First the acrobot
pumps back and forth several times symmetrically, with the second link always
down. Then, once enough energy has been added to the system, the second
link is swung upright and stabbed to the goal height.

14.4 Elevator Dispatching

Waiting for an elevator is a situation with which we are all familiar. We press a
button and then wait for an elevator to arrive traveling in the right direction.
We may have to wait a long time if there are too many passengers or not
enough elevators. Just how long we wait depends on the dispatching strategy
the elevators use to decide where to go. For example, if passengers on several
ﬂoors have requested pickups, which should be served ﬁrst? If there are no
pickup requests, how should the elevators distribute themselves to await the
next request? Elevator dispatching is a good example of a stochastic optimal
control problem of economic importance that is too large to solve by classical
techniques such as dynamic programming.

Crites and Barto (1996; Crites, 1996) studied the application of reinforce-
ment learning techniques to the four-elevator, ten-ﬂoor system shown in Fig-
ure 14.8. Along the right-hand side are pickup requests and an indication
of how long each has been waiting. Each elevator has a position, direction,
and speed, plus a set of buttons to indicate where passengers want to get
oﬀ. Roughly quantizing the continuous variables, Crites and Barto estimated
that the system has over 1022 states. This large state set rules out classi-
cal dynamic programming methods such as value iteration. Even if one state
could be backed up every microsecond it would still require over 1000 years to
complete just one sweep through the state space.

14.4. ELEVATOR DISPATCHING

287

Figure 14.8: Four elevators in a ten-story building.

In practice, modern elevator dispatchers are designed heuristically and eval-
uated on simulated buildings. The simulators are quite sophisticated and de-
tailed. The physics of each elevator car is modeled in continuous time with
continuous state variables. Passenger arrivals are modeled as discrete, stochas-
tic events, with arrival rates varying frequently over the course of a simulated
day. Not surprisingly, the times of greatest traﬃc and greatest challenge to the
dispatching algorithm are the morning and evening rush hours. Dispatchers
are generally designed primarily for these diﬃcult periods.

The performance of elevator dispatchers is measured in several diﬀerent
ways, all with respect to an average passenger entering the system. The aver-
age waiting time is how long the passenger waits before getting on an elevator,
and the average system time is how long the passenger waits before being
dropped oﬀ at the destination ﬂoor. Another frequently encountered statistic
is the percentage of passengers whose waiting time exceeds 60 seconds. The
objective that Crites and Barto focused on is the average squared waiting time.
This objective is commonly used because it tends to keep the waiting times
low while also encouraging fairness in serving all the passengers.

Crites and Barto applied a version of one-step Q-learning augmented in
several ways to take advantage of special features of the problem. The most
important of these concerned the formulation of the actions. First, each ele-
vator made its own decisions independently of the others. Second, a number
of constraints were placed on the decisions. An elevator carrying passengers
could not pass by a ﬂoor if any of its passengers wanted to get oﬀ there, nor

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

could it reverse direction until all of its passengers wanting to go in its current
direction had reached their ﬂoors. In addition, a car was not allowed to stop
at a ﬂoor unless someone wanted to get on or oﬀ there, and it could not stop to
pick up passengers at a ﬂoor if another elevator was already stopped there. Fi-
nally, given a choice between moving up or down, the elevator was constrained
always to move up (otherwise evening rush hour traﬃc would tend to push all
the elevators down to the lobby). These last three constraints were explicitly
included to provide some prior knowledge and make the problem easier. The
net result of all these constraints was that each elevator had to make few and
simple decisions. The only decision that had to be made was whether or not
to stop at a ﬂoor that was being approached and that had passengers waiting
to be picked up. At all other times, no choices needed to be made.

That each elevator made choices only infrequently permitted a second sim-
pliﬁcation of the problem. As far as the learning agent was concerned, the
system made discrete jumps from one time at which it had to make a decision
to the next. When a continuous-time decision problem is treated as a discrete-
time system in this way it is known as a semi-Markov decision process. To a
large extent, such processes can be treated just like any other Markov decision
process by taking the reward on each discrete transition as the integral of the
reward over the corresponding continuous-time interval. The notion of return
generalizes naturally from a discounted sum of future rewards to a discounted
integral of future rewards:

(cid:90)

where Rt on the left is the usual immediate reward in discrete time and Rt+τ
on the right is the instantaneous reward at continuous time t + τ .
In the
elevator problem the continuous-time reward is the negative of the sum of the
squared waiting times of all waiting passengers. The parameter β > 0 plays a
role similar to that of the discount-rate parameter γ

[0, 1).

∈

The basic idea of the extension of Q-learning to semi-Markov decision prob-
lems can now be explained. Suppose the system is in state S and takes action
A at time t1, and then the next decision is required at time t2 in state S(cid:48).
After this discrete-event transition, the semi-Markov Q-learning backup for a
tabular action-value function, Q, would be:

14.4. ELEVATOR DISPATCHING

289

One complication is that the reward as deﬁned—the negative sum of the
squared waiting times—is not something that would normally be known while
an actual elevator was running. This is because in a real elevator system one
does not know how many people are waiting at a ﬂoor, only how long it has
been since the button requesting a pickup on that ﬂoor was pressed. Of course
this information is known in a simulator, and Crites and Barto used it to
obtain their best results. They also experimented with another technique that
used only information that would be known in an on-line learning situation
with a real set of elevators. In this case one can use how long since each button
has been pushed together with an estimate of the arrival rate to compute an
expected summed squared waiting time for each ﬂoor. Using this in the reward
measure proved nearly as eﬀective as using the actual summed squared waiting
time.

For function approximation, a nonlinear neural network trained by back-
propagation was used to represent the action-value function. Crites and Barto
experimented with a wide variety of ways of representing states to the network.
After much exploration, their best results were obtained using networks with
47 input units, 20 hidden units, and two output units, one for each action.
The way the state was encoded by the input units was found to be critical to
the eﬀectiveness of the learning. The 47 input units were as follows:

•

•

•

•

•

18 units: Two units encoded information about each of the nine hall
buttons for down pickup requests. A real-valued unit encoded the elapsed
time if the button had been pushed, and a binary unit was on if the
button had not been pushed.

16 units: A unit for each possible location and direction for the car whose
decision was required. Exactly one of these units was on at any given
time.

10 units: The location of the other elevators superimposed over the 10
ﬂoors. Each elevator had a “footprint” that depended on its direction
and speed. For example, a stopped elevator caused activation only on
the unit corresponding to its current ﬂoor, but a moving elevator caused
activation on several units corresponding to the ﬂoors it was approaching,
with the highest activations on the closest ﬂoors. No information was
provided about which one of the other cars was at a particular location.

1 unit: This unit was on if the elevator whose decision was required was
at the highest ﬂoor with a passenger waiting.

1 unit: This unit was on if the elevator whose decision was required was
at the ﬂoor with the passenger who had been waiting for the longest
amount of time.

elevator made its decisions independently of the other elevators, but shared
a single reward signal with them. This introduced additional stochasticity as
far as each elevator was concerned because its reward depended in part on the
actions of the other elevators, which it could not control. In the architecture
in which each elevator had its own action-value function, it was possible for
diﬀerent elevators to learn diﬀerent specialized strategies (although in fact
they tended to learn the same strategy). On the other hand, the architecture
with a common action-value function could learn faster because it learned
simultaneously from the experiences of all elevators. Training time was an issue
here, even though the system was trained in simulation. The reinforcement
learning methods were trained for about four days of computer time on a 100
mips processor (corresponding to about 60,000 hours of simulated time). While
this is a considerable amount of computation, it is negligible compared with
what would be required by any conventional dynamic programming algorithm.

The networks were trained by simulating a great many evening rush hours
while making dispatching decisions using the developing, learned action-value
functions. Crites and Barto used the Gibbs softmax procedure to select ac-
tions as described in Section 2.3, reducing the “temperature” gradually over
training. A temperature of zero was used during test runs on which the per-
formance of the learned dispatchers was assessed.

include methods similar to those commonly used in the industry, a variety
of heuristic methods, sophisticated research algorithms that repeatedly run
complex optimization algorithms on-line (Bao et al., 1994), and dispatchers
learned by using the two reinforcement learning architectures. By all of the
performance measures, the reinforcement learning dispatchers compare favor-
ably with the others. Although the optimal policy for this problem is unknown,
and the state of the art is diﬃcult to pin down because details of commercial
dispatching strategies are proprietary, these learned dispatchers appeared to
perform very well.

14.5 Dynamic Channel Allocation

An important problem in the operation of a cellular telephone system is how
to eﬃciently use the available bandwidth to provide good service to as many
customers as possible. This problem is becoming critical with the rapid growth
in the use of cellular telephones. Here we describe a study due to Singh and
Bertsekas (1997) in which they applied reinforcement learning to this problem.

Mobile telephone systems take advantage of the fact that a communication
channel—a band of frequencies—can be used simultaneously by many callers
if these callers are spaced physically far enough apart that their calls do not
interfere with each another. The minimum distance at which there is no inter-
ference is called the channel reuse constraint. In a cellular telephone system,
the service area is divided into a number of regions called cells. In each cell
is a base station that handles all the calls made within the cell. The total
available bandwidth is divided permanently into a number of channels. Chan-
nels must then be allocated to cells and to calls made within cells without
violating the channel reuse constraint. There are a great many ways to do
this, some of which are better than others in terms of how reliably they make
channels available to new calls, or to calls that are “handed oﬀ” from one cell
to another as the caller crosses a cell boundary. If no channel is available for
a new or a handed-oﬀ call, the call is lost, or blocked. Singh and Bertsekas
considered the problem of allocating channels so that the number of blocked
calls is minimized.

A simple example provides some intuition about the nature of the problem.
Imagine a situation with three cells sharing two channels. The three cells are
arranged in a line where no two adjacent cells can use the same channel without
violating the channel reuse constraint. If the left cell is serving a call on channel
1 while the right cell is serving another call on channel 2, as in the left diagram
below, then any new call arriving in the middle cell must be blocked.

292

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

Obviously, it would be better for both the left and the right cells to use channel
1 for their calls. Then a new call in the middle cell could be assigned channel 2,
as in the right diagram, without violating the channel reuse constraint. Such
interactions and possible optimizations are typical of the channel assignment
problem.
In larger and more realistic cases with many cells, channels, and
calls, and uncertainty about when and where new calls will arrive or existing
calls will have to be handed oﬀ, the problem of allocating channels to minimize
blocking can become extremely complex.

The simplest approach is to permanently assign channels to cells in such a
way that the channel reuse constraint can never be violated even if all channels
of all cells are used simultaneously. This is called a ﬁxed assignment method.
In a dynamic assignment method, in contrast, all channels are potentially
available to all cells and are assigned to cells dynamically as calls arrive. If
this is done right, it can take advantage of temporary changes in the spatial
and temporal distribution of calls in order to serve more users. For example,
when calls are concentrated in a few cells, these cells can be assigned more
channels without increasing the blocking rate in the lightly used cells.

The channel assignment problem can be formulated as a semi-Markov de-
cision process much as the elevator dispatching problem was in the previous
section. A state in the semi-MDP formulation has two components. The ﬁrst
is the conﬁguration of the entire cellular system that gives for each cell the
usage state (occupied or unoccupied) of each channel for that cell. A typical
cellular system with 49 cells and 70 channels has a staggering 7049 conﬁgura-
tions, ruling out the use of conventional dynamic programming methods. The
other state component is an indicator of what kind of event caused a state
transition: arrival, departure, or handoﬀ. This state component determines
what kinds of actions are possible. When a call arrives, the possible actions
are to assign it a free channel or to block it if no channels are available. When
a call departs, that is, when a caller hangs up, the system is allowed to reassign
the channels in use in that cell in an attempt to create a better conﬁguration.
At time t the immediate reward, Rt, is the number of calls taking place at
that time, and the return is

Gt =

∞

e−

βτ Rt+τ dτ,

0
(cid:90)

where β > 0 plays a role similar to that of the discount-rate parameter γ. Max-
imizing the expectation of this return is the same as minimizing the expected
(discounted) number of calls blocked over an inﬁnite horizon.

1211214.5. DYNAMIC CHANNEL ALLOCATION

293

This is another problem greatly simpliﬁed if treated in terms of afterstates
(Section 6.6). For each state and action, the immediate result is a new con-
ﬁguration, an afterstate. A value function is learned over just these conﬁgu-
rations. To select among the possible actions, the resulting conﬁguration was
determined and evaluated. The action was then selected that would lead to
the conﬁguration of highest estimated value. For example, when a new call
arrived at a cell, it could be assigned to any of the free channels, if there were
any; otherwise, it had to be blocked. The new conﬁguration that would result
from each assignment was easy to compute because it was always a simple de-
terministic consequence of the assignment. When a call terminated, the newly
released channel became available for reassigning to any of the ongoing calls.
In this case, the actions of reassigning each ongoing call in the cell to the newly
released channel were considered. An action was then selected leading to the
conﬁguration with the highest estimated value.

Linear function approximation was used for the value function: the esti-
mated value of a conﬁguration was a weighted sum of features. Conﬁgurations
were represented by two sets of features: an availability feature for each cell
and a packing feature for each cell–channel pair. For any conﬁguration, the
availability feature for a cell gave the number of additional calls it could accept
without conﬂict if the rest of the cells were frozen in the current conﬁguration.
For any given conﬁguration, the packing feature for a cell–channel pair gave
the number of times that channel was being used in that conﬁguration within
a four-cell radius of that cell. All of these features were normalized to lie be-
tween
1 and 1. A semi-Markov version of linear TD(0) was used to update
the weights.

Singh and Bertsekas compared three channel allocation methods using a
simulation of a 7
7 cellular array with 70 channels. The channel reuse con-
straint was that calls had to be 3 cells apart to be allowed to use the same chan-
nel. Calls arrived at cells randomly according to Poisson distributions possibly
having diﬀerent means for diﬀerent cells, and call durations were determined
randomly by an exponential distribution with a mean of three minutes. The
methods compared were a ﬁxed assignment method (FA), a dynamic alloca-
tion method called “borrowing with directional channel locking” (BDCL), and
the reinforcement learning method (RL). BDCL (Zhang and Yum, 1989) was
the best dynamic channel allocation method they found in the literature. It is
a heuristic method that assigns channels to cells as in FA, but channels can be
borrowed from neighboring cells when needed. It orders the channels in each
cell and uses this ordering to determine which channels to borrow and how
calls are dynamically reassigned channels within a cell.

Figure 14.10 shows the blocking probabilities of these methods for mean
arrival rates of 150, 200, and 350 calls/hour as well as for a case in which

diﬀerent cells had diﬀerent mean arrival rates. The reinforcement learning
method learned on-line. The data shown are for its asymptotic performance,
but in fact learning was rapid. The RL method blocked calls less frequently
than did the other methods for all arrival rates and soon after starting to learn.
Note that the diﬀerences between the methods decreased as the call arrival rate
increased. This is to be expected because as the system gets saturated with
calls there are fewer opportunities for a dynamic allocation method to set up
favorable usage patterns. In practice, however, it is the performance of the
unsaturated system that is most important. For marketing reasons, cellular
telephone systems are built with enough capacity that more than 10% blocking
is rare.

Nie and Haykin (1996) also studied the application of reinforcement learn-
ing to dynamic channel allocation. They formulated the problem somewhat
diﬀerently than Singh and Bertsekas did. Instead of trying to minimize the
probability of blocking a call directly, their system tried to minimize a more
indirect measure of system performance. Cost was assigned to patterns of
channel use depending on the distances between calls using the same chan-
nels. Patterns in which channels were being used by multiple calls that were
close to each other were favored over patterns in which channel-sharing calls
were far apart. Nie and Haykin compared their system with a method called
MAXAVAIL (Sivarajan, McEliece, and Ketchum, 1990), considered to be one
of the best dynamic channel allocation methods. For each new call, it selects
the channel that maximizes the total number of channels available in the en-
tire system. Nie and Haykin showed that the blocking probability achieved by
their reinforcement learning system was closely comparable to that of MAX-
AVAIL under a variety of conditions in a 49-cell, 70-channel simulation. A

key point, however, is that the allocation policy produced by reinforcement
learning can be implemented on-line much more eﬃciently than MAXAVAIL,
which requires so much on-line computation that it is not feasible for large
systems.

The studies we described in this section are so recent that the many ques-
tions they raise have not yet been answered. We can see, though, that there
can be diﬀerent ways to apply reinforcement learning to the same real-world
problem.
In the near future, we expect to see many reﬁnements of these
applications, as well as many new applications of reinforcement learning to
problems arising in communication systems.

14.6 Job-Shop Scheduling

Many jobs in industry and elsewhere require completing a collection of tasks
while satisfying temporal and resource constraints. Temporal constraints say
that some tasks have to be ﬁnished before others can be started; resource
constraints say that two tasks requiring the same resource cannot be done
simultaneously (e.g., the same machine cannot do two tasks at once). The
objective is to create a schedule specifying when each task is to begin and
what resources it will use that satisﬁes all the constraints while taking as
little overall time as possible. This is the job-shop scheduling problem. In its
general form, it is NP-complete, meaning that there is probably no eﬃcient
procedure for exactly ﬁnding shortest schedules for arbitrary instances of the
problem. Job-shop scheduling is usually done using heuristic algorithms that
take advantage of special properties of each speciﬁc instance.

Zhang and Dietterich (1995, 1996; Zhang, 1996) were motivated to apply
reinforcement learning to job-shop scheduling because the design of domain-
speciﬁc, heuristic algorithms can be expensive and time-consuming. Their
goal was to show how reinforcement learning can be used to learn how to
quickly ﬁnd constraint-satisfying schedules of short duration in speciﬁc do-
mains, thereby reducing the amount of hand engineering required. They ad-
dressed the NASA space shuttle payload processing problem (SSPP), which
requires scheduling the tasks required for installation and testing of shuttle
cargo bay payloads. An SSPP typically requires scheduling for two to six
shuttle missions, each requiring between 34 and 164 tasks. An example of
a task is MISSION-SEQUENCE-TEST, which has a duration of 7200 time
units and requires the following resources: two quality control oﬃcers, two
technicians, one ATE, one SPCDS, and one HITS. Some resources are divided
into pools, and if a task needs more than one resource of a speciﬁc type, the
resources must belong to the same pool, and the pool has to be the right one.

296

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

For example, if a task needs two quality control oﬃcers, they both have to be
in the pool of quality control oﬃcers working on the same shift at the right
site.
It is not too hard to ﬁnd a conﬂict-free schedule for a job, one that
meets all the temporal and resource constraints, but the objective is to ﬁnd a
conﬂict-free schedule with the shortest possible total duration, which is much
more diﬃcult.

How can you do this using reinforcement learning? Job-shop scheduling
is usually formulated as a search in the space of schedules, what is called a
discrete, or combinatorial, optimization problem. A typical solution method
would sequentially generate schedules, attempting to improve each over its
predecessor in terms of constraint violations and duration (a hill-climbing, or
local search, method). You could think of this as a nonassociative reinforce-
ment learning problem of the type we discussed in Chapter 2 with a very large
number of possible actions: all the possible schedules! But aside from the
problem of having so many actions, any solution obtained this way would just
be a single schedule for a single job instance. In contrast, what Zhang and
Dietterich wanted their learning system to end up with was a policy that could
quickly ﬁnd good schedules for any SSPP. They wanted it to learn a skill for
job-shop scheduling in this speciﬁc domain.

For clues about how to do this, they looked to an existing optimization
approach to SSPP, in fact, the one actually in use by NASA at the time of
their research: the iterative repair method developed by Zweben and Daun
(1994). The starting point for the search is a critical path schedule, a schedule
that meets the temporal constraints but ignores the resource constraints. This
schedule can be constructed eﬃciently by scheduling each task prior to launch
as late as the temporal constraints permit, and each task after landing as early
as these constraints permit. Resource pools are assigned randomly. Two types
of operators are used to modify schedules. They can be applied to any task
that violates a resource constraint. A Reassign-Pool operator changes the
pool assigned to one of the task’s resources. This type of operator applies only
if it can reassign a pool so that the resource requirement is satisﬁed. A Move
operator moves a task to the ﬁrst earlier or later time at which its resource
needs can be satisﬁed and uses the critical path method to reschedule all of
the task’s temporal dependents.

At each step of the iterative repair search, one operator is applied to the
current schedule, selected according to the following rules. The earliest task
with a resource constraint violation is found, and a Reassign-Pool oper-
ator is applied to this task if possible. If more than one applies, that is, if
several diﬀerent pool reassignments are possible, one is selected at random.
If no Reassign-Pool operator applies, then a Move operator is selected at
random based on a heuristic that prefers short-distance moves of tasks having

14.6. JOB-SHOP SCHEDULING

297

few temporal dependents and whose resource requirements are close to the
task’s overallocation. After an operator is applied, the number of constraint
violations of the resulting schedule is determined. A simulated annealing pro-
cedure is used decide whether to accept or reject this new schedule. If ∆V
denotes the number of constraint violations removed by the repair, then the
∆V /T ), where T is the cur-
new schedule is accepted with probability exp(
rent computational temperature that is gradually decreased throughout the
search. If accepted, the new schedule becomes the current schedule for the
next iteration; otherwise, the algorithm attempts to repair the old schedule
again, which will usually produce diﬀerent results due to the random decisions
involved. Search stops when all constraints are satisﬁed. Short schedules are
obtained by running the algorithm several times and selecting the shortest of
the resulting conﬂict-free schedules.

Zhang and Dietterich treated entire schedules as states in the sense of
reinforcement learning. The actions were the applicable Reassign-Pool and
Move operators, typically numbering about 20. The problem was treated
as episodic, each episode starting with the same critical path schedule that
the iterative repair algorithm would start with and ending when a schedule
was found that did not violate any constraint. The initial state—a critical
path schedule—is denoted S0. The rewards were designed to promote the
quick construction of conﬂict-free schedules of short duration. The system
0.001) on each step that resulted in a
received a small negative reward (
schedule that still violated a constraint. This encouraged the agent to ﬁnd
conﬂict-free schedules quickly, that is, with a small number of repairs to S0.
Encouraging the system to ﬁnd short schedules is more diﬃcult because what
it means for a schedule to be short depends on the speciﬁc SSPP instance. The
shortest schedule for a diﬃcult instance, one with a lot of tasks and constraints,
will be longer than the shortest schedule for a simpler instance. Zhang and
Dietterich devised a formula for a resource dilation factor (RDF), intended to
be an instance-independent measure of a schedule’s duration. To account for
an instance’s intrinsic diﬃculty, the formula makes use of a measure of the
resource overallocation of S0. Since longer schedules tend to produce larger
RDFs, the negative of the RDF of the ﬁnal conﬂict-free schedule was used as
a reward at the end of each episode. With this reward function, if it takes N
repairs starting from a schedule s to obtain a ﬁnal conﬂict-free schedule, Sf ,
0.001(N
the return from s is

RDF (Sf )

1).

−

−

−

This reward function was designed to try to make a system learn to satisfy
the two goals of ﬁnding conﬂict-free schedules of short duration and ﬁnding
conﬂict-free schedules quickly. But the reinforcement learning system really
has only one goal—maximizing expected return—so the particular reward val-
ues determine how a learning system will tend to trade oﬀ these two goals.

298

CHAPTER 14. APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

0.001 means that the
Setting the immediate reward to the small value of
learning system will regard one repair, one step in the scheduling process, as
being worth 0.001 units of RDF. So, for example, if from some schedule it is
possible to produce a conﬂict-free schedule with one repair or with two, an
optimal policy will take extra repair only if it promises a reduction in ﬁnal
RDF of more than 0.001.

−

Zhang and Dietterich used TD(λ) to learn the value function. Function
approximation was by a multilayer neural network trained by backpropagating
TD errors. Actions were selected by an ε-greedy policy, with ε decreasing
during learning. One-step lookahead search was used to ﬁnd the greedy action.
Their knowledge of the problem made it easy to predict the schedules that
would result from each repair operation. They experimented with a number of
modiﬁcations to this basic procedure to improve its performance. One was to
use the TD(λ) algorithm backward after each episode, with the eligibility trace
extending to future rather than to past states. Their results suggested that this
was more accurate and eﬃcient than forward learning. In updating the weights
of the network, they also sometimes performed multiple weight updates when
the TD error was large. This is apparently equivalent to dynamically varying
the step-size parameter in an error-dependent way during learning.

They also tried an experience replay technique due to Lin (1992). At any
point in learning, the agent remembered the best episode up to that point.
After every four episodes, it replayed this remembered episode, learning from
it as if it were a new episode. At the start of training, they similarly allowed
the system to learn from episodes generated by a good scheduler, and these
could also be replayed later in learning. To make the lookahead search faster
for large-scale problems, which typically had a branching factor of about 20,
they used a variant they called random sample greedy search that estimated
the greedy action by considering only random samples of actions, increasing
the sample size until a preset conﬁdence was reached that the greedy action of
the sample was the true greedy action. Finally, having discovered that learning
could be slowed considerably by excessive looping in the scheduling process,
they made their system explicitly check for loops and alter action selections
when a loop was detected. Although all of these techniques could improve the
eﬃciency of learning, it is not clear how crucial all of them were for the success
of the system.

Zhang and Dietterich experimented with two diﬀerent network architec-
tures. In the ﬁrst version of their system, each schedule was represented using
a set of 20 handcrafted features. To deﬁne these features, they studied small
scheduling problems to ﬁnd features that had some ability to predict RDF. For
example, experience with small problems showed that only four of the resource
pools tended to cause allocation problems. The mean and standard deviation

14.6. JOB-SHOP SCHEDULING

299

of each of these pools’ unused portions over the entire schedule were computed,
resulting in 10 real-valued features. Two other features were the RDF of the
current schedule and the percentage of its duration during which it violated
resource constraints. The network had 20 input units, one for each feature, a
hidden layer of 40 sigmoidal units, and an output layer of 8 sigmoidal units.
The output units coded the value of a schedule using a code in which, roughly,
the location of the activity peak over the 8 units represented the value. Us-
ing the appropriate TD error, the network weights were updated using error
backpropagation, with the multiple weight-update technique mentioned above.

The second version of the system (Zhang and Dietterich, 1996) used a
more complicated time-delay neural network (TDNN) borrowed from the ﬁeld
of speech recognition (Lang, Waibel, and Hinton, 1990). This version divided
each schedule into a sequence of blocks (maximal time intervals during which
tasks and resource assignments did not change) and represented each block by
a set of features similar to those used in the ﬁrst program. It then scanned
a set of “kernel” networks across the blocks to create a set of more abstract
features. Since diﬀerent schedules had diﬀerent numbers of blocks, another
layer averaged these abstract features over each third of the blocks. Then a
ﬁnal layer of 8 sigmoidal output units represented the schedule’s value using
the same code as in the ﬁrst version of the system. In all, this network had
1123 adjustable weights.

A set of 100 artiﬁcial scheduling problems was constructed and divided into
subsets used for training, determining when to stop training (a validation set),
and ﬁnal testing. During training they tested the system on the validation
set after every 100 episodes and stopped training when performance on the
validation set stopped changing, which generally took about 10,000 episodes.
They trained networks with diﬀerent values of λ (0.2 and 0.7), with three
diﬀerent training sets, and they saved both the ﬁnal set of weights and the
set of weights producing the best performance on the validation set. Counting
each set of weights as a diﬀerent network, this produced 12 networks, each of
which corresponded to a diﬀerent scheduling algorithm.

Figure 14.11 shows how the mean performance of the 12 TDNN networks
(labeled G12TDN) compared with the performances of two versions of Zweben
and Daun’s iterative repair algorithm, one using the number of constraint
violations as the function to be minimized by simulated annealing (IR-V)
and the other using the RDF measure (IR-RDF). The ﬁgure also shows the
performance of the ﬁrst version of their system that did not use a TDNN
(G12N). The mean RDF of the best schedule found by repeatedly running
an algorithm is plotted against the total number of schedule repairs (using a
log scale). These results show that the learning system produced scheduling
algorithms that needed many fewer repairs to ﬁnd conﬂict-free schedules of the

mission from Zhang and Dietterich, 1996.

same quality as those found by the iterative repair algorithms. Figure 14.12
compares the computer time required by each scheduling algorithm to ﬁnd
schedules of various RDFs. According to this measure of performance, the
best trade-oﬀ between computer time and schedule quality is produced by
the non-TDNN algorithm (G12N). The TDNN algorithm (G12TDN) suﬀered
due to the time it took to apply the kernel-scanning process, but Zhang and
Dietterich point out that there are many ways to make it run faster.

These results do not unequivocally establish the utility of reinforcement
learning for job-shop scheduling or for other diﬃcult search problems. But
they do suggest that it is possible to use reinforcement learning methods to
learn how to improve the eﬃciency of search. Zhang and Dietterich’s job-
shop scheduling system is the ﬁrst successful instance of which we are aware
in which reinforcement learning was applied in plan-space, that is, in which
states are complete plans (job-shop schedules in this case), and actions are plan
modiﬁcations. This is a more abstract application of reinforcement learning
than we are used to thinking about. Note that in this application the system
learned not just to eﬃciently create one good schedule, a skill that would
not be particularly useful; it learned how to quickly ﬁnd good schedules for
a class of related scheduling problems. It is clear that Zhang and Dietterich
went through a lot of trial-and-error learning of their own in developing this
example. But remember that this was a groundbreaking exploration of a new
aspect of reinforcement learning. We expect that future applications of this
kind and complexity will become more routine as experience accumulates.

Prospects

In this book we have tried to present reinforcement learning not as a collection
of individual methods, but as a coherent set of ideas cutting across methods.
Each idea can be viewed as a dimension along which methods vary. The set
of such dimensions spans a large space of possible methods. By exploring
this space at the level of dimensions we hope to obtain the broadest and
most lasting understanding. In this chapter we use the concept of dimensions
in method space to recapitulate the view of reinforcement learning we have
developed in this book and to identify some of the more important gaps in our
coverage of the ﬁeld.

15.1 The Uniﬁed View

All of the reinforcement learning methods we have explored in this book have
three key ideas in common. First, the objective of all of them is the estimation
of value functions. Second, all operate by backing up values along actual or
possible state trajectories. Third, all follow the general strategy of general-
ized policy iteration (GPI), meaning that they maintain an approximate value
function and an approximate policy, and they continually try to improve each
on the basis of the other. These three ideas that the methods have in common
circumscribe the subject covered in this book. We suggest that value func-
tions, backups, and GPI are powerful organizing principles potentially relevant
to any model of intelligence.

Two of the most important dimensions along which the methods vary are
shown in Figure 15.1. These dimensions have to do with the kind of backup
used to improve the value function. The horizontal dimension is whether they
are sample backups (based on a sample trajectory) or full backups (based

303

304

CHAPTER 15. PROSPECTS

on a distribution of possible trajectories). Full backups of course require a
model, whereas sample backups can be done either with or without a model
(another dimension of variation). The vertical dimension corresponds to the
depth of backups, that is, to the degree of bootstrapping. At three of the
four corners of the space are the three primary methods for estimating values:
DP, TD, and Monte Carlo. Along the left edge of the space are the sample-
backup methods, ranging from one-step TD backups to full-return Monte Carlo
backups. Between these is a spectrum including methods based on n-step
backups and mixtures of n-step backups such as the λ-backups implemented
by eligibility traces.

DP methods are shown in the extreme upper-right corner of the space be-
cause they involve one-step full backups. The lower-right corner is the extreme
case of full backups so deep that they run all the way to terminal states (or, in
a continuing task, until discounting has reduced the contribution of any further
rewards to a negligible level). This is the case of exhaustive search. Intermedi-

ate methods along this dimension include heuristic search and related methods
that search and backup up to a limited depth, perhaps selectively. There are
also methods that are intermediate along the horizontal dimension. These
include methods that mix full and sample backups, as well as the possibility
of methods that mix samples and distributions within a single backup. The
interior of the square is ﬁlled in to represent the space of all such intermediate
methods.

A third important dimension is that of function approximation. Function
approximation can be viewed as an orthogonal spectrum of possibilities ranging
from tabular methods at one extreme through state aggregation, a variety
of linear methods, and then a diverse set of nonlinear methods. This third
dimension might be visualized as perpendicular to the plane of the page in
Figure 15.1.

Another dimension that we heavily emphasized in this book is the binary
distinction between on-policy and oﬀ-policy methods. In the former case, the
agent learns the value function for the policy it is currently following, whereas
in the latter case it learns the value function for the policy that it currently
thinks is best. These two policies are often diﬀerent because of the need
to explore. The interaction between this dimension and the bootstrapping
and function approximation dimension discussed in Chapter 9 illustrates the
advantages of analyzing the space of methods in terms of dimensions. Even
though this did involve an interaction between three dimensions, many other
dimensions were found to be irrelevant, greatly simplifying the analysis and
increasing its signiﬁcance.

In addition to the four dimensions just discussed, we have identiﬁed a

number of others throughout the book:

Deﬁnition of return Is the task episodic or continuing, discounted or undis-

counted?

Action values vs. state values vs. afterstate values What kind of val-
ues should be estimated? If only state values are estimated, then either
a model or a separate policy (as in actor–critic methods) is required for
action selection.

Action selection/exploration How are actions selected to ensure a suitable
trade-oﬀ between exploration and exploitation? We have considered only
the simplest ways to do this: ε-greedy and softmax action selection, and
optimistic initialization of values.

Synchronous vs. asynchronous Are the backups for all states performed

simultaneously or one by one in some order?

306

CHAPTER 15. PROSPECTS

Replacing vs. accumulating traces If eligibility traces are used, which kind

is most appropriate?

Real vs. simulated Should one backup real experience or simulated experi-

ence? If both, how much of each?

Location of backups What states or state–action pairs should be backed
up? Modelfree methods can choose only among the states and state–
action pairs actually encountered, but model-based methods can choose
arbitrarily. There are many potent possibilities here.

Timing of backups Should backups be done as part of selecting actions, or

only afterward?

Memory for backups How long should backed-up values be retained? Should

they be retained permanently, or only while computing an action selec-
tion, as in heuristic search?

Of course, these dimensions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive.
Individual algorithms diﬀer in many other ways as well, and many algorithms
lie in several places along several dimensions. For example, Dyna methods use
both real and simulated experience to aﬀect the same value function. It is also
perfectly sensible to maintain multiple value functions computed in diﬀerent
ways or over diﬀerent state and action representations. These dimensions do,
however, constitute a coherent set of ideas for describing and exploring a wide
space of possible methods.

15.2 State Estimation

15.3 Temporal Abstraction

15.4 Predictive Representations

15.5 Other Frontier Dimensions

Much research remains to be done within this space of reinforcement learning
methods. For example, even for the tabular case no control method using
multistep backups has been proved to converge to an optimal policy. Among
planning methods, basic ideas such as trajectory sampling and focusing sample
backups are almost completely unexplored. On closer inspection, parts of the

15.5. OTHER FRONTIER DIMENSIONS

307

space will undoubtedly turn out to have far greater complexity and greater
internal structure than is now apparent. There are also other dimensions along
which reinforcement learning can be extended, we have not yet mentioned,
that lead to a much larger space of methods. Here we identify some of these
dimensions and note some of the open questions and frontiers that have been
left out of the preceding chapters.

One of the most important extensions of reinforcement learning beyond
what we have treated in this book is to eliminate the requirement that the
state representation have the Markov property. There are a number of inter-
esting approaches to the non-Markov case. Most strive to construct from the
given state signal and its past values a new signal that is Markov, or more
nearly Markov. For example, one approach is based on the theory of partially
observable MDPs (POMDPs). POMDPs are ﬁnite MDPs in which the state
is not observable, but another “sensation” signal stochastically related to the
state is observable. The theory of POMDPs has been extensively studied for
the case of complete knowledge of the dynamics of the POMDP. In this case,
Bayesian methods can be used to compute at each time step the probability of
the environment’s being in each state of the underlying MDP. This probability
distribution can then be used as a new state signal for the original problem.
The downside for the Bayesian POMDP approach is its computational ex-
pense and its strong reliance on complete environment models. Some of the
recent work pursuing this approach is by Littman, Cassandra, and Kaelbling
(1995), Parr and Russell (1995), and Chrisman (1992).
If we are not willing
to assume a complete model of a POMDP’s dynamics, then existing theory
seems to oﬀer little guidance. Nevertheless, one can still attempt to construct
a Markov state signal from the sequence of sensations. Various statistical and
ad hoc methods along these lines have been explored (e.g., Chrisman, 1992;
McCallum, 1993, 1995; Lin and Mitchell, 1992; Chapman and Kaelbling, 1991;
Moore, 1994; Rivest and Schapire, 1987; Colombetti and Dorigo, 1994; White-
head and Ballard, 1991; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).

All of the above methods involve constructing an improved state repre-
sentation from the non-Markov one provided by the environment. Another
approach is to leave the state representation unchanged and use methods that
are not too adversely aﬀected by its being non-Markov (e.g., Singh, Jaakkola,
and Jordan, 1994, 1995; Jaakkola, Singh and Jordan, 1995).
In fact, most
function approximation methods can be viewed in this way. For example, state
aggregation methods for function approximation are in eﬀect equivalent to a
non-Markov representation in which all members of a set of states are mapped
into a common sensation. There are other parallels between the issues of func-
tion approximation and non-Markov representations. In both cases the overall
problem divides into two parts: constructing an improved representation, and

308

CHAPTER 15. PROSPECTS

making do with the current representation. In both cases the “making do”
part is relatively well understood, whereas the constructive part is unclear
and wide open. At this point we can only guess as to whether or not these
parallels point to any common solution methods for the two problems.

Another important direction for extending reinforcement learning beyond
what we have covered in this book is to incorporate ideas of modularity and
hierarchy. Introductory reinforcement learning is about learning value func-
tions and one-step models of the dynamics of the environment. But much of
what people learn does not seem to fall exactly into either of these categories.
For example, consider what we know about tying our shoes, making a phone
call, or traveling to London. Having learned how to do such things, we are
then able to choose among them and plan as if they were primitive actions.
What we have learned in order to do this are not conventional value functions
or one-step models. We are able to plan and learn at a variety of levels and
ﬂexibly interrelate them. Much of our learning appears not to be about learn-
ing values directly, but about preparing us to quickly estimate values later in
response to new situations or new information. Considerable reinforcement
learning research has been directed at capturing such abilities (e.g., Watkins,
1989; Dayan and Hinton, 1993; Singh, 1992a, 1992b; Ring, 1994, Kaelbling,
1993b; Sutton, 1995).

Researchers have also explored ways of using the structure of particular
tasks to advantage. For example, many problems have state representations
that are naturally lists of variables, like the readings of multiple sensors or ac-
tions that are lists of component actions. The independence or near indepen-
dence of some variables from others can sometimes be exploited to obtain more
eﬃcient special forms of reinforcement learning algorithms. It is sometimes
even possible to decompose a problem into several independent subproblems
that can be solved by separate learning agents. A reinforcement learning prob-
lem can usually be structured in many diﬀerent ways, some reﬂecting natural
aspects of the problem, such as the existence of physical sensors, and others
being the result of explicit attempts to decompose the problem into simpler
subproblems. Possibilities for exploiting structure in reinforcement learning
and related planning problems have been studied by many researchers (e.g.,
Boutilier, Dearden, and Goldszmidt, 1995; Dean and Lin, 1995). There are
also related studies of multiagent or distributed reinforcement learning (e.g.,
Littman, 1994; Markey, 1994; Crites and Barto, 1996; Tan, 1993).

Finally, we want to emphasize that reinforcement learning is meant to be a
general approach to learning from interaction. It is general enough not to re-
quire special-purpose teachers and domain knowledge, but also general enough
to utilize such things if they are available. For example, it is often possible
to accelerate reinforcement learning by giving advice or hints to the agent

(Clouse and Utgoﬀ, 1992; Maclin and Shavlik, 1994) or by demonstrating in-
structive behavioral trajectories (Lin, 1992). Another way to make learning
easier, related to “shaping” in psychology, is to give the learning agent a series
of relatively easy problems building up to the harder problem of ultimate inter-
est (e.g., Selfridge, Sutton, and Barto, 1985). These methods, and others not
yet developed, have the potential to give the machine-learning terms training
and teaching new meanings that are closer to their meanings for animal and
human learning.
